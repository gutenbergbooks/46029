<h3>EVERY CITY NEEDS
A CITY PLAN NOW</h3>

<p>The congestion exhibit in New York
last spring proved one of the most effective
and startling means of making a
contented community sit up and think
about its "other half." It formulated
questions half formed in many minds and
demanded answers. Its influence was
felt over the whole country, and its discussions
have bobbed up here and there
and everywhere ever since in articles, conferences
and addresses.</p>

<p>That the congestion exhibit answered
questions as well as asked them, and that
it has a constructive program to offer
not only to New York but to the whole
country are amply proved by the decision
just reached, and announced to-day for
the first time, to hold an exhibit and conference
of city planning next March.
"Every American city needs a city plan
now," is the conclusion of the committee,
and the steps by which it has arrived at
this conclusion are interestingly set forth
in its announcement.</p>

<p>While the organization bears the name
of the Committee on Congestion of Population
in New York, its scope and purpose
are much wider. The program approved
by its executive committee is "to
obtain a plan for the development of
Greater New York, and other American
cities, along economic, hygienic and aesthetic
lines; and to promote the better
distribution of population throughout
city, state and nation."</p>

<p>To establish the need for such a program,
the committee offers as "admitted
facts" the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many American cities with a population
of over 50,000 have congestion of population,
factories and offices; such congestion creates
problems for which we cannot find solutions;
no city should use all the land within its
boundaries as intensively as is necessary in
its most congested areas,&mdash;to do so perpetuates
congestion; no American city yet has
a legal right to prescribe the height and use
of buildings in its various sections; no city
can develop normally without a plan which
anticipates its growth for twenty-five or fifty
years.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a means of stimulating consideration
of the subject and of promoting farsighted
planning for the future, the committee
has adopted as its slogan the statement,
"Every American city needs a city
plan now." It will show, it announces,
the cost of the lack of a city plan in New
York, the city planning which has been
done in some American and foreign cities,
and the pressing need for a city plan in
New York to-day. The conference on
city planning in March will include an
exhibit of the best developments from all
over the world. Both exhibit and conference
will be keyed up to two major considerations:
"the concentration of one-half
the population of a great state in one
city makes the problem of statewide importance;
the concentration of one-nineteenth
of a nation's population in one
city gives the problem national bearing."</p>

<p>There will be study of the best methods
for distribution of population, for promoting
feasible methods of locating factories
and industrial colonies, and an educational
campaign to show the advantages
of migration from congested centers.</p>


<h3>EMPLOYERS PAY
FOR SANATORIUM CARE</h3>

<p>Massachusetts, almost invariably a
leader in preventive measures, is developing
this year a most unique and promising
kind of co-operative effort in the
prevention of tuberculosis. Massachusetts
was the first state to organize a
board of health, dating from 1869. It
was the first state to choose its factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
inspectors from the medical profession,
this dating from 1906, and out of these
two farsighted provisions of the law has
grown during the past two months a plan
by which manufacturers are assuming a
part of the financial burden in seeing to
it that operatives in their factories, found
to have tuberculosis in the incipient
stage, are sent to the Rutland Sanatorium
and given the best possible opportunity
for cure.</p>

<p>The plan originated in Worcester
which, with a string of neighboring
towns and villages, forms one of the sixteen
inspection districts into which the
state is divided. As a result of the activity
of Dr. M. G. Overlock, the state
inspector of health in charge, seventy
manufacturing plants, employing more
than 20,000 hands, have followed the example
of David H. Fanning, president of
the Royal Worcester Corset Company,
in agreeing to pay a part of the maintenance
cost of any of their employes
sent to Rutland. The cost in the sanatorium
is nine dollars a week. Of this
the state pays five dollars and the company
four dollars. The term usually
agreed upon is three months. At the
end of that time, a large number of the
cases have been so far restored that
they can be taken to nearby, supervised
boarding houses and farms and make
room for new patients,&mdash;a plan hit upon
to relieve the great pressure upon this
institution which accepts only incipient
cases. The employer continues his contribution.
The boarding houses, conducted
along approved lines, have sprung
up all over the surrounding hills much as
they have at Saranac Lake in New York.</p>

<p>The factory inspection has been keyed
up to take the greatest possible advantage
of the co-operation of employers.
Frequent visits are made to all plants,
but to those in which the work rooms
are full of dust, or where there are
other conditions favoring tuberculosis,
Dr. Overlock makes a visit once a
month. All minors on the working staff
are taken before him, and required to
furnish a full family history. If there
has been tuberculosis in the family, even
remote, a medical examination is at once
made. The others are examined more
superficially, but the least trace of suspicious
symptoms is at once seized upon
as cause for an examination. In this
way, it is believed, incipient cases among
minors will be caught in their earliest
stages. The system will later be extended
to adults. An extension of the
plan to secure the interest and help of
employers has begun in some other inspection
districts, and will eventually be
introduced throughout the state.</p>

<p>But the carefully laid plans to detect
and ward off incipient cases comprise
only one part of the Massachusetts plan
to fight tuberculosis. In May three
homes for advanced cases will be opened,
and the development of the plan calls
for additional homes, scattered through
the state, until it shall have made complete
provision for all cases, early or
advanced. In view of the almost unanimously
expressed opinion at the recent
International Tuberculosis Congress,
that the strategic point of attack in the
campaign is in isolating advanced cases,
the provision of these homes is, perhaps,
the most important plank in the Massachusetts
health platform. Governor
Guild is much interested in the whole
plan. In a recent letter to Dr. Overlock
he wrote: "It has been a great pleasure
for me to inaugurate the new policy of
the commonwealth of provision for all
cases of tuberculosis, not merely as at
present the care of the curable, but the
care of the incurable as well."</p>


<h3>SALARY LOANS
IN CINCINNATI</h3>

<p>The business of lending money on
salaries and wages has received a practical
knockout blow in Cincinnati
through the <i>Commercial Tribune</i>, which
instituted the crusade, with the co-operation
of the officials of the city and of
various private organizations.</p>

<p>Aided by an ordinance which orders
the licensing of salary loan offices and
which makes a weekly report to the city
auditor necessary, the campaigners have
already been able to put one office out of
business entirely, and to sew up all the
others in the courts in such a way that
it now seems very likely that most of
these will retire rather than face the
storm which awaits them.</p>

<p>D. H. Tolman is more deeply involved
in Cincinnati than he has ever been before.
His son, E. E. Tolman, who is
said to be connected with the business of
his father, is under arrest and is now
waiting a hearing in the police court.
His manager has been arrested and convicted
on three counts.</p>

<p>Although these cases have been appealed
to a higher court, an application
for an order to restrain the further interference
with the Tolman business has
thus far been refused.</p>

<p>D. H. Tolman has ordered his manager
in Cincinnati to refuse to comply
with the ordinance and unless the courts
do issue this order the manager will be
arrested every week.</p>

<p>The <i>Commercial Tribune</i> has secured
all of the Tolman forms from a former
manager. These have all been printed
together with a letter from the ex-manager
in which the latter makes a complete
expos&eacute; of the methods pursued behind the
doors of one of his offices.</p>

<p>The auditor of Cincinnati has declared
his purpose of keeping up the fight.
He has forced ten salary loan offices to
pay a license fee and to comply with
the provisions of the local ordinance.
Agents have been permanently employed
by the official to watch the loan
offices and to ferret out any new agents
who may attempt to operate secretly.</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Society which was recently
formed to advise the poor, has
made it its business to impress upon all
who seek its meetings the futility of borrowing
money from the salary loan people
and has furnished a list of the companies
which are classified as "loan
sharks," to every man and woman whom
it could reach.</p>

<p>In this way people who never read
the newspapers are given information
which they otherwise would probably
never receive.</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Society is also at work
on a code of laws which will be submitted
to the General Assembly at its
coming session and which it is hoped
will solve the question of loaning money
on salaries and chattels in Ohio for all
time.</p>

<p>The attorneys of the society promise
a law which will set a fixed rate, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
will include interest and expenses, on all
such loans. It is said now that this rate
will be either three or four per cent.
The contemplated law will also contain
a provision which will make the recovery
of usury possible.</p>

<p>It is further planned to have a provision
in the law similar to the Massachusetts
statute, requiring the signatures
of the wife, when a borrower is married,
and of his employer. Some of the
best attorneys in Cincinnati including
former Prosecuting Attorney Benton
Oppenheimer, are at work on these laws.</p>

<p>Another movement now on foot is the
founding of a salary loan office on the
same basis as several chattel loan offices
which are now operating in the country,
whose stockholders are philanthropists
and men of wealth.</p>

<p>Cincinnati has such a chattel loan company
and the men who are now fighting
the salary loan business there are urging
the stockholders of this company to take
up the other work.</p>

<p>The most gratifying thing of the Cincinnati
campaign has been the falling
off of business in the loan offices. The
companies admit this and one broker left
for Florida after explaining that his
business had decreased seventy-five per
cent during the campaign.</p>


<h3>FOR A COURT OF
DOMESTIC RELATIONS</h3>

<p>One of the interesting bills to be
brought before the 1909 session of the
New York Legislature is that drawn by
Bernhard Rabbino, relating to a special
domestic relations court. Mr. Rabbino
believes that if we have courts for the
purpose of divorce, for separating mothers
from children and children from fathers,
we should have a separate tribunal
to which families in discord could appeal.</p>

<p>There are probably from 12,000 to 15,000
domestic trouble cases handled yearly
in Manhattan and the Bronx alone, but
as no records are kept of summons
cases,&mdash;and these come under that
head,&mdash;it is not possible to compute the
exact number. Probably it is greater
than the number of cases handled by the
children's court, and a domestic relations
court is justified by Mr. Rabbino, additionally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
on the ground that it precedes
the children's court, having for its fundamental
purpose the preservation of the
family as a unit, with an opportunity for
fathers and mothers to secure the same
expert and individual attention that is
given to the children.</p>

<p>Domestic affairs are admittedly out of
place in a general police court. The unfortunate
participants are not in any sense
criminals, and yet they are surrounded
by thieves, pickpockets, drunkards, disorderly
persons,&mdash;the regular rabble of
the criminal court,&mdash;and an outraged self-respect
is the consequence of such treatment.
The present organization of magistrates'
courts contemplates that the magistrate
shall sit one-half of the day on the
bench and the other half shall be in
chambers for the settlement of just such
cases as Mr. Rabbino would bring before
the domestic relations court. As a matter
of practice, however, so congested are
the courts and so pressing their work,
that there is no time for this personal
consideration which the law contemplates.
The magistrate does what he can in the
face of tremendous difficulties, but he has
not the time to investigate these cases,
and without proper attention there can be
no adjustment of them. Divorce and
separation are the natural results.</p>

<p>The idea of such a court would be to
prevent litigation as a whole and particularly
to safeguard the homes of the poor,
for the poor are those who are obliged to
resort to police courts. The better-off
take their affairs to the Supreme Court.
It is very possible that these lower courts
might develop into something higher, and
many matrimonial difficulties which now
cause a permanent rupture of relations
be peaceably adjusted with judicial assistance.
Such a court might also have a
marked effect on juvenile crime, for any
force that makes for better home conditions
is preventive of crime. The bill requires
also that the court of domestic relations
have exclusive jurisdiction over
all cases of abandonment, non-support,
and the non-support of poor relatives as
provided by law.</p>

<p>The bill as drawn would make this domestic
relations court part of the city
magistrates' courts, on the lines of the
children's courts now being generally
established throughout the country. The
idea, however, would be to have a special
court altogether, and if successful,
this would probably be done.</p>

<p>The introduction of this bill in the Legislature
may bring to sharp discussion the
whole question of division of jurisdiction
in the city courts. The present
established principle is that such courts
should be divided geographically, covering
a certain borough or section of a borough.
The children's court differs radically
from this and introduces a functional
division. It is an open question
whether, with the police courts crowded
as they are, such a functional division has
not become necessary for more cases than
those of delinquent children,&mdash;whether
the separation of special kinds of cases
into children's courts and into courts of
domestic relations will not prove more
effective than a further division of territory.</p>


<h3>THE YEAR IN
MUNICIPAL EVENTS</h3>

<p>A review of municipal events and
tendencies for the past year, which might
be the title of Clinton Rogers Woodruff's
report as secretary of the National Municipal
League, centers around efficiency
and honesty in government as a result
of clear accounting systems and understandable
statistics; wide-spread efforts at
charter revision; a constantly growing
sentiment for nomination reform; and a
militant desire, evident in many sections,
to tackle the problems which have grown
up around the saloon in politics.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Bureau of Municipal
Statistics, the first of its kind, has already
resulted, Mr. Woodruff believes,
in a number of cities reconstructing their
accounts on a sounder and more substantial
basis. The first year's report shows
a confusing lack of system in handling
the receipts and disbursements of towns
and cities; a wide variety of dates for
closing the fiscal year; many defects in
the treasurers' methods of accounting;
and the need for consolidation of the administration
of trust funds. In many
instances, money left to the community
for special purposes has been used by the
town trustees for general purposes.</p>

<p>But "the movement for uniform accounting
proceeds without interruption."
Originated by the National Municipal
League, it was given momentum by the
Census Bureau and by legislation in Ohio
and Massachusetts. Accounting investigations
and reforms are being made the
basis for an approach to the solution of
important problems in Boston, in New
York by the conspicuous work of the Bureau
of Municipal Research, and in Minneapolis.
The point of attack in Minneapolis
has been the administration of
the school fund "which seems to have
been particularly inadequate and inefficient."
A grand jury found "a startling
and deplorably loose state of affairs."
The investigation was made by trained
men from San Francisco and other Pacific
Coast cities. In Wilmington there
has been a thoroughgoing examination of
municipal account.</p>

<p>Legislative reference bureaus are being
established to help in this movement, of
particular value to Chicago which "is
on the threshold of an era of public improvement
which will call for the most
intelligent direction from the city government."
Mr. Woodruff predicts that "we
may expect within the next half dozen
years to find a series of similar bureaus
established in all the leading cities, gathering
for their respective municipalities
information concerning improvement;
and, moreover, we may expect a further
development, in that all of these bureaus
and libraries will be so co-ordinated, each
with the others, as to form a strong chain
of information that will banish from the
halls of legislation and the offices of administration,
the dense ignorance that all
too frequently found a welcome lodgement."</p>

<p>Charter changes are pressed every year
more strongly to the front. It is true now
that wherever a good government organization
of any sort is found, there will be
accompanying it a campaign either for
a new charter or for amendments to the
existing one. Perhaps the most noticeable
tendency of the movement is a demand
for a greater degree of home rule
for the cities which have been "subjected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
to a degree of legislative buffeting that
has well nigh destroyed the cherished
ideal of self-government."</p>

<p>Nomination reform has been much discussed,
and a number of laws providing
for direct nominations have become effective
during the year. Mr. Woodruff
holds that the results of direct nominations
have, on the whole, "recommended
themselves to those who are striving for
the elimination of nomination monopoly
and for the inauguration of a simpler and
more direct form of election machinery."
Further, he holds that "it is now generally
conceded, except by a very small and
diminishing group of men, that the preparation
and distribution of the ballots
at the general election is a proper state
function and expense."</p>

<p>The objections to direct nominations
are discussed at length and finally dismissed
with the conclusion: "We must
realize that we are living in a democracy,
and that the election machinery must be
democratic and must record the wishes
of the people and be responsive to their
desires. Direct nominations are a step in
advance because they enable the people
directly to express their wishes. No
doubt they have made their mistakes, and
will continue to make them; but they
have had to bear the brunt of them in the
past, and they must continue to bear them
in the future; and this in the long run will
prove to be the most effective way of
building up an enlightened and efficient
democracy."</p>

<p>The initiative and referendum are advocated,
because "they are unquestionably
proving effective in breaking down some
of the privileges and monopolies that have
characterized political organizations for
many years."</p>


<h3>TO STIMULATE
PARKS AND PLAY</h3>

<p>The Council of One Hundred, an auxiliary
to the Parks and Playgrounds Association
of New York, has been fully
organized by Miss Pauline Robinson and
Seth Thayer Stewart, with a membership
of well known men and women who
are interested in playground activities
and civic improvement. At the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
meeting of the council at the home of
Mrs. Charles B. Alexander, in December,
Richard Watson Gilder presided, introducing
Mrs. George C. Riggs (Kate
Douglas Wiggin), who read a valuable
paper. Eugene A. Philbin, president of
the Parks and Playgrounds Association,
outlined the development of that organization,
which is the union of the Brooklyn
Society for Parks and Playgrounds
and the Metropolitan Parks Association.
Howard Bradstreet, the secretary of the
association, gave through lantern slides
a synopsis of the active work in conducting
playgrounds and baseball centers
during the last season. Seth Thayer
Stewart sketched a possible plan for the
extension of the recreation idea throughout
the city, and Dr. Luther H. Gulick
spoke briefly on recreation for girls.</p>

<p>The Council of One Hundred, of which
Mr. Gilder is president, Jacob H. Schiff,
George D. Pratt, Mrs. Frederick W.
Whitridge and Mrs. Samuel Bowne Duryea,
vice-presidents; and Miss Pauline
Robinson, secretary and treasurer, will
meet two or three times a year. Its purpose
is to assist individually and as a
body in the active work of the Parks and
Playgrounds Association. While much
is being done by the city through park
and school in the way of offering play
facilities to children, nevertheless, so
great is their number in New York, that
only a small percentage of the possibilities
have as yet been realized. With a
million children of school age or under,
occupied only a small part of the time,
the street must be the chief resort for the
large majority.</p>

<p>The experience of last summer showed
both the feasibility and the good result of
organizing the children of the street by
play leaders who appreciate the value of
free play, and are acquainted with child
nature. The plan of work as outlined
calls for the placing of such play leaders
in various sections of the city; the encouraging
of the establishment of places
for recreation by different organizations
and neighborhood committees, and for
the provision and maintenance of various
forms of play throughout the year in sections
otherwise neglected. During the
summer the association maintained eight
vacant lots as playgrounds, eleven baseball
centers and a camp for boys. The
neighbors of several of these grounds
have asked to have them extended during
the winter, and the association will
undertake to do so early in the new year.</p>


<h3>NEW YORK STATE
TRADE SCHOOL PLANS</h3>

<p>Much significance is attached to the
recent organization of the New York
state branch of the National Society
for the Promotion of Industrial
Education. The passage of the industrial
education bill last year opened up to
the state possibilities in the way of industrial
education which it has not thus
far been able to measure. A volunteer
body of some sort has been needed to
awaken interest and stir up the whole
state. Particular opportunity offers
among the up-state cities and it was with
this in mind that the officers and advisory
board were elected, for as the list shows,
the members are representative of the
state as a whole as well as of many lines
of industrial and educational activity.
The officers are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>President, James P. McElroy, manager of
the Consolidated Car Heating Company, Albany;
vice-president, Dr. Andrew S. Draper,
state commissioner of education, Albany;
secretary-treasurer, Arthur L. Williston,
Pratt Institute, Brooklyn.</p></blockquote>

<p>Additional members of the executive
committee are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>V. Everit Macy, chairman of Board of
Trustees, Teachers' College, New York; Joseph
R. Campbell, president Diamond Saw
and Stamping Works, Buffalo; Thomas D.
Fitzgerald, president Allied Printing Trades
Council of New York State, Albany; Frank
L. Babbott, manufacturer and member of the
School Board, Brooklyn.</p></blockquote>

<p>At a public meeting following the formation
of the branch, considerable enthusiasm
was developed and a number
of interesting papers were read. Of
these, perhaps the most substantial contribution
to the discussion of the evening
was by Dr. William H. Maxwell, city
superintendent of schools, New York,
who presided. Among other things Dr.
Maxwell said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Certain things may be taken as demonstrated
with regard to industrial education:</p>

<p>First, trade schools are needed. They are
needed for the sake of our industrial wealth
and efficiency. They are needed for the
sake of the boys and girls of this city. The
best preparation for a trade is the manual
training high school where, in connection
with elements of a liberal education, students
receive instruction in drawing, in
tools, and in applications of art to industry.
But these schools breed engineers, not journeymen.
Hence we need schools to give
training that will shorten and enrich the
period of apprenticeship for the journeyman.</p>

<p>Second, such schools must be a part of
the public school system and must articulate
directly and closely with the elementary
schools, to the end that boys and girls between
fourteen and eighteen, or at least
sixteen, may obtain that training which will
enable them to be of use in a shop; because
it is in the public schools that the boys and
girls are found who need such training.</p>

<p>Third, to carry out this articulation, elementary
schools should have manual training
to discover these boys and girls who
have an aptitude for mechanical pursuits.
Brains are as necessary in mechanical pursuits
as in law or theology.</p>

<p>Certain difficulties stand in our way:</p>

<p>First, apathy of manufacturers who have
shown little desire to obtain really skilled
American workmen, as for example, the firm
which established a school to train apprentices
and found that they were taken away
by other firms as soon as they had learned
a few tricks of the trade.</p>

<p>Second, apathy of the financial authorities
of the city who have just cut out the amount
asked for by the Board of Education for
shops and kitchens, and given only $22,000
for a trade school. It is encouraging, however,
to remember that the first annual appropriation
for manual training in Brooklyn
was only $5,000. If we make good use of
the small appropriation, the demonstration
will secure larger appropriations in the
future.</p>

<p>Third, the foolish or nebulous arguments
of many of those who have been advocating
trade schools. Arguments have been foolish
when they became pleas for the elimination
of existing high schools and the conversion
of these institutions into trade
schools. Those that have not been foolish
have been largely nebulous, vapory exhortations
to establish trade schools, without the
substance of a well considered plan. Such
a well considered plan is now the great desideratum.
While the advocates of trade
schools have been talking, the Board of Education
has established and maintained five
prosperous and useful evening trade schools
which are patronized largely by apprentices.
Those evening trade schools confine their operations
chiefly to the building and machinists'
trades. Shall we stop there? Will our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
friends not give us a plan for teaching our
three largest trades, clothing, beer brewing,
and sugar refining? What we need farther
is a well thought-out plan of co-operation
between the school and the manufacturer,
such as that at Fitchburg, Mass.</p>

<p>For these reasons,&mdash;the apathy of manufacturers,
the apathy of the financial authorities
of our city, and the need of definite, coherent
plans,&mdash;the cause of trade schools
stands sorely in need of the aid of this local
branch of the national society. The time
is surely opportune when the Board of Education
has appointed a standing committee
on this subject and when the state, through
the industrial education bill, passed last
winter by the Legislature, has decided to
give substantial financial assistance to any
community that established trade schools.</p></blockquote>


<h3>TO RESTRAIN
HOLIDAY BEGGING</h3>

<p>The mummery and begging in which
the children of New York city so generally
indulge Thanksgiving Day and
other holidays have long been matters
of concern and alarm to those who are
interested in educational work with
young people. Many articles have appeared
denouncing the custom. On the
morning of Thanksgiving, the New York
<i>Times</i> contained an especially well directed
effort to protest against this growing
evil.</p>

<p>The children of Asacog Social Settlement,
52 Sands street, Brooklyn, partake
very generally in these holiday mummeries,
masquerading and begging. The
harmful results have long been realized,
but the efforts heretofore used to modify
the custom have been quite ineffective.
It was resolved this year to undertake
a different method of modifying the nuisance.</p>

<p>It was found in all cases that the children
had no idea why they should choose
Thanksgiving for begging, beyond the
fact that people gave them money on that
day and all their playmates chose this
method of "having fun," so of course it
was necessary to be in the game.</p>

<p>So with "having a good time" in mind,
parents, young people, children, were invited
to a festival on Thanksgiving eve.
It seemed quite necessary to draw a
moral lesson in the attempt to overthrow
such a deeply seated custom, and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
done through a series of tableaus and
dances with connecting narrative.</p>

<p>The probable historical setting of the
Thanksgiving custom was presented
through scenes of the Dutch in Holland,
during the troublesome times of William
of Orange, when the sea beggars made
their famous pledge. Two tableaus
showing the court scene and the banquet
of the beggars were followed by a costume
dance by small boys, which was
called the "beggars' march." The English
contribution to the celebrations was
in tableaus from the history of the Guy
Fawkes plot. The Dutch and English
transferred to America were shown by
Peter Stuyvesant and his surrender; the
southern scenes with their harvest ideas
through a colored plantation sketch; the
Puritans and Indians by tableaus and Indian
squaw dances. Then followed the
times of the Revolution, with the tyranny
of the British, the spirit of '76, and the
Evacuation Day celebration on November
25, 1783.</p>

<p>The tableaus were given in costume by
the young people and children, about
seventy-five taking part. The members
of the Civic Club, composed of mothers
and neighborhood women did a great
deal in preparing the costumes and dressing
the actors.</p>

<p>The settlement had the valuable help of
Miss Mari R. Hofer in preparing Dutch
and Indian dances, and of Howard Bradstreet,
the narrator of the evening.</p>

<p>Admission was by tickets given in clubs
and classes, and the seating capacity of
three hundred and twenty-five was taxed
to over five hundred. But the carnival
spirit was in the midst and no one minded
the necessity of standing on a chair with
a friend or two in order to catch an occasional
glimpse of the stage. Several of
the star performers became so interested
in the audience that it was necessary to
snatch the nearest boys or girls as the occasion
demanded, hustle them to the improvised
"green" room, hastily dress
them in remaining fragments of costumes
far removed from the historic time, and
with impromptu coaching from the
wings, an attitude was struck worthy of
any Dutch patriot or Puritan dignitary.</p>

<p>The most gratifying results of the performance
were that the begging on the
street was greatly diminished. Many of
the children did dress up and beg, for of
course we could not expect a complete
reformation on Sands street. But up to
eleven o'clock not a begging child had
been seen on Asacog corner. Later in
the day little beggars began to appear
but in smaller numbers and at three
o'clock in the afternoon, a very lively
hour, all the children on the block were
out playing their ordinary street games,
and but one child was in fancy costume.
From one tenement from which twenty
children begged last year, but two indulged
this year, one mother having been
to the festival, and really beginning to
realize the dangers of street gaieties for
the first time, refused to permit her eight
year old girl to parade in fancy dress, at
which the child volunteered to stay in
bed, feeling life was too dull for words,
and besides she was tired from the night
before, the carnival spirit having worked
itself out. In reality it was the "day after
the fun."</p>


<h3>FOLK DANCES
IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL</h3>

<p>The pupils in the Lincoln School, situated
in the suburbs of Burlington, Iowa,
feel no restraint from want of room to
play, for the school grounds are as large
as a small park, and stretches of prairie
land roll before and behind the building.
Beautiful oaks and elms form tiny forests
round about, a brook rushes through
the outskirts, and in each season nature
calls so loudly to the boy that it requires
all the ingenuity of teachers and truant
officers to keep him in school. Many nationalities
have congregated in this part
of the city, for it is a factory district, and
each September there are enrolled little
Germans, Russians, Swiss and Irish who
are instinctively antagonistic to one another.</p>

<p>The teachers of Lincoln School have
found it advisable to be present during
the noon hour, as well as during recess,
to prevent the playing of rough games
in which many children were injured,
or which resulted in fighting.</p>

</div>

<p>About ten years ago a may-pole was
introduced, which revolutionized the
school. A small organ was carried into
the yard and as many as forty children
took part in this dance at the same time.
About five years ago, fearing that this
dance would become monotonous, other
folk dances were introduced, and now
one may see during all intermissions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
groups of boys and girls dancing the <i>gavotte
der kaiserin</i>, Irish reel, Highland
fling, sword dance, dance of the Alpine
peasants and the minuet. In order that
even these should not become uninteresting,
costumes have been provided for
each dance, and this is bound to be the
greatest aid in discipline; for what boy
will play truant when he can impersonate
Washington in the minuet or some Scottish
hero in the sword dance or Highland
fling. To defray the expense of the
costumes, a play was given,&mdash;Spyri's
Heidi. This met with such success that
they now have a dramatic club, whose
members have presented Old-Fashioned
Girl, Eight Cousins and Little Baron to
large audiences in the Opera House.
Many unruly boys have become docile,
after impersonating some genuinely honest
boy character. The manners and
dress of both boys and girls have been
much improved since they have taken
part in these plays.</p>

<p>The folk-dances have been used in this
school for so many years that all are prepared
to say that they are a success with
the boys in as great a degree as they are
with the girls. A boy seldom refuses to
join in the dances. The most enjoyable
period during the session is the time of
the rhythmic play. They need no other
punishment for disobedience than to
threaten to refuse to play for the folk
dances.</p>


<h3>THE STANDARD FOR A
CITY'S SURVEY</h3>

<p class="right">GRAHAM TAYLOR</p>

<p>Social research on a city-wide scale is
a contemporary product. Appropriately
old London was the first to have its living
conditions comprehensively investigated.
To Charles Booth belongs the
credit of having initiated and set the type
of such enquiry. His great work in seventeen
volumes on Life and Labor in
London standardized methods and results
in some lines of civic investigation. Its
data were almost entirely derived from
secondary documentary sources furnished
by official records and the reports of voluntary
agencies, but the originality with
which it is everywhere stamped lies in the
handling and verifying of the material
thus acquired. The whole great analysis
and synthesis of the largest city population
of the world, thus attempted for the
first time, deserves to be ranked as one
of the greatest achievements of the closing
decade of the nineteenth century.
That this brave pioneering was attempted
by one of London's great shippers, and
that it was so successfully carried
through to completion at a cost of twenty
years of labor and a quarter million of
dollars, also sets a standard of self-exacting
citizenship worthy alike of the world's
greatest city and of one of its most modest
and personally resourceful citizens.</p>

<p>The extent to which this survey of
London afforded intelligent incentive and
basis for the reconstructive civic spirit
and work which attended and followed
it is demonstrated by contemporary history.
The voluntary efforts to improve
conditions, and the London County Council's
achievement in increasing open and
street spaces and in furnishing housing
and other equipment for city life, were on
a scale befitting the foundation in fact
substantially laid by Mr. Booth's monumental
work. Liverpool, Glasgow, Birmingham
and many provincial cities received
impetus and direction in their
heroic efforts to ascertain and improve
their own conditions.</p>

<p>Seebohm Rowntree followed Mr.
Booth's example in his study of poverty
in York, but went beyond his methods in
making a first hand investigation of the
facts. Robert W. deForest and Lawrence
Veiller set the type for American
enquiry into city conditions by their investigation
and reports of the Tenement
House Problem in New York. And now
the Pittsburgh Survey registers the most
inclusive standard thus far set in ascertaining
the facts of living conditions in a
typical industrial community. In cooperating
to carry through this constructive
survey the Russell Sage Foundation
and this magazine achieve the most
noteworthy fulfilment of their common
purpose to improve social and living
conditions in the United States.</p>

<p>These two
Christmas
stamps are next
of kin. Our Red
Cross stamp is
the youngest
child of the
Danish <i>Julemarke</i>
which
sprang out of a
country postmaster's
brain to take
its place among the
most effective
weapons in the
world-wide fight
with the white
plague. Of what
stout stock the
family are,&mdash;it is a big family by this
time, with sons and daughters in many
lands,&mdash;this year's issue of the Danish
stamp tells at a glance. For the big building
pictured in it is the "Christmas Stamp
Sanatorium," built for tuberculous children
out of the half pennies the Danish
people have given these five years as their
contribution to the great campaign.</p>

</div>

<p>Denmark is a little country. All in
all it has not much more than half as
many people as the Greater New York,
if indeed it has so many. Yet in so short
a time it has wrought so great a tangible
result. What it has further wrought in
the way of arousing public interest and
guiding public education in this matter
is beyond calculation. For the last is
the biggest end of the work of the Christmas
stamp, wherever it goes.</p>

<p>In New York city two years ago we
raised a great outcry about child cripples,
made so by tuberculosis. We counted
five thousand or more in the tenements
of the metropolis and decided that their
one chance of life lay in building a hospital
on the seashore, on the lines of the
little one now run on Coney Island by the
Association for the Improvement of the
Condition of the Poor. Forthwith money
was raised, a quarter of a million of dollars,
to build a much bigger one with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
and architects were set to work to draw
plans. The city appropriated a site in a
great seashore park, to be laid out for
the people. Then there happened what
so often happens in New York when a
great public enterprise is to be carried
out. It ran into a rut, somehow. Money
became tight, the controller could not
find the funds, park and hospital were
side-tracked and stayed so.</p>

<p>They are side-tracked yet. The money
kind-hearted New Yorkers gave for the
children is in the bank. The little cripples
still crawl around their tenements.
The winds blow over the ocean and waste
their healing balm. The park is as far
away as ever. And the purses of the
charitable snap with an extra twist of
tightness when they think of it all. Next
time we shall plead the children's cause
in vain.</p>

<p>That is the way of New York. The
picture above tells the way of poor little
Denmark. No doubt there is an excuse,
or a string of them, for the American
city. But excuses do not mend aching
joints and wasted frames. How long before
New York will catch up with Denmark?
Would it not be fine if this lusty

<h3>RAILWAY ACCIDENTS</h3>

<p class="right">EMORY R. JOHNSON</p>

<p class="right">University of Pennsylvania</p>

<p>The Confessions of a Railroad Signalman
by J. O. Fagan is an exceptionally
able book, worthy of the serious attention
of every student of the causes of
railroad accidents.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The author gives
his qualifications for writing the book
by saying that he "has been a telegraph
operator and tower-man for twenty-seven
years and part of the time chief clerk
to a railroad superintendent," and he further
adds that "the extent of territory
covered by this experience is even wider
than one would suppose. For a telegraph
operator is, of necessity, one of the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>posted men in the service." In addition
to this experience from which a knowledge
of the subject has been gained, the
author possesses a remarkably well
trained mind and has command of exceptionally
clean English.</p>

<p>The main thesis of the book is that accidents
are due mainly to non-observance
of rules. "Railroad managers, therefore,
sooner or later will come to understand
that the one thing needed in the railroad
service at the present day is to educate
employes to appreciate the fact that successful
and safe railroading in the future
will have to depend, not upon the multiplication
of safety devices or the reconstruction
of rules, but upon the personal
effort and conduct of conscientious, alert,
and careful men." Furthermore, the author
has "arrived at the conclusion that
on our railroads the interests of the community
have become secondary to those
of the employe and his organization."
Mr. Fagan also maintains that "it is actually
a matter of reasonable demonstration
that at least seventy-five per cent of
the casualties might be avoided by increase
of interest on the part of the employe,
and the earnest concentration of
his best thought on the subject."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 681px;">

<div class="caption"><p>FROM CONFESSIONS OF A RAILROAD SIGNALMAN</p></div>
</div>

<p>The natural remedy for the situation,
as stated by Mr. Fagan, would lie in the
observance by employes of the company's
rules and regulations, in the discipline by
the management of all employes for each
and every non-observance of any rule,
and the enforcement of discipline with
appropriate penalties regardless of the
personality of those subjected to discipline.
The enforcement of discipline,
moreover, should not be made to depend
upon consequences resulting from non-observance
of rules. Employes should
be penalized by loss of pay for their disregard
of the rules or regulations whether
their actions do or do not result in
casualties.</p>

<p>Mr. Fagan, however, believes, and
brings convincing evidence to show, that
the above remedy is beyond hope. The
organizations of which the railroad employes
are members take the position that
the member who violates a rule is to be
defended against condemnation by the
public or discipline by the management.
Instead of taking the view that the interests
of the public are paramount to
those of any individual railroad employe,
the railroad employes' organization seeks
invariably to shield its members against
the consequences of their actions. Furthermore,
the managers of most railroads
have decided that the strict enforcement
of the rules and the punishment of those
who do not observe the rules result in
so many controversies with the labor
unions and are so destructive of harmonious
relations between the company and
the unions, that it is better to strive for
harmony rather than to enforce discipline.
In other words, discipline and the safety
of the public are made subsidiary to the
maintenance of harmonious relations
with the employes. Such being the situation,
Mr. Fagan believes that reform
is not to be expected within railway management
but must come from
the outside as the result of the
exercise of governmental authority.
The government
must punish employes for non-observance
of rules and penalize
railroad officers for the
non-enforcement of their regulations.</p>

<p>The analyses and arguments
of the book are convincing.
The position taken by Mr.
Fagan is one the accuracy of
which will doubtless be vigorously
denied by the organizations
of railroad employes and
will be to some extent questioned
by the responsible management of
railroads. However, it seems to the author
of this review that Mr. Fagan has
established his thesis.</p>


<h3>INDUSTRIAL ITALY</h3>

<p class="right">ARTHUR P. KELLOGG</p>

<p>The simple Italian peasant, he whose
meager village life was so accurately
drawn by Mr. Mangano in earlier issues
of this magazine, is familiar in every
city in this country, and we have in
America what is probably a fair appreciation
of his poverty, his hardships and
the longing for better things which send
great blocks of the population of rural
provinces flocking across the Atlantic.
Of industrial Italy we know less, having
few sources of information. If the
life of the factory towns is really as bad
as The Forewarners,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by Giovanni Cena,
makes it,&mdash;if wages are as low, work as
hard, housing as squalid and amusements
as few,&mdash;then we have in the book a
story of remarkable growth in wretchedness,
for the manufacturing towns of
northern Italy are, as Mrs. Humphry
Ward points out in the introduction to the
English translation, only forty years old.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Forewarners, Giovanni Cena, 1908, New
York, Doubleday, Page and Company. Price $1.50.
This book may be ordered at publisher's price
through the office of <span class="smcap">Charities and The Commons.</span></p></div>

<p>The book makes clear the source of the
socialist vote in the Italian Parliament
and the human stuff which the railway
and other big strikes are made of. It is,
supposedly, the life story of a Turin
printer. Starting as the son of a clay
digger, he graduates into the working
world after a childhood spent in an orphanage.
Having some little education
more than his fellows, he becomes a
proofreader for a house which is putting
on the Italian market the standard works
of science and philosophy in all languages.
This gives him stronger meat
than a weak body and an overwrought
mind can digest, and he becomes oppressed
with the wrongs of his class, with
the grind of the factory and the squalid
life of the house where he has a tiny
cell in the garret. There he piles up, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>proof sheets, a library of the greatest
books in the world. Pouring over them
by night, half-fed, unsociable, brooding,
his mind slips gradually from its moorings
and he throws his life away as a
sacrifice, for this book, the story of his
life and the story of his class, is hidden
in his bosom. A tragic death, he believes,
will cause it to be published and set afoot
nothing short of a revolution.</p>

<p>The book does not tell the manner of
his death, but it implies that he threw
himself in front of the King's automobile,
which he often met in his wanderings
outside the city. It typified to him the
oppression which he felt,&mdash;"the griefs of
others I have such a longing to relieve
that the desire becomes a torment to me,
and I cannot shake myself free from it
except by action." Of the automobile
drivers he had written: "Whilst the nobility
are trying to draw in their claws
so as not to exasperate us, here come
these bourgeoise parvenus to insult us
in our own house. Yes, in our own house,
for the highroad belongs to the peasant
and the poor man." His studies, which
put him above the other workmen, were
themselves his undoing, for the substance
of Tolstoi and Spencer became so much
more to him than the form, that his work
grew bad and worse until he was discharged,&mdash;an
incident convincing to one
who has attempted to read proof with an
eye to things greater than commas and
spelling.</p>

<p>Out of it all he worked a scheme of
things as they ought to be, which, whether
it came from the proofreader or from the
author who takes a proofreader's smarting
sense of wrong as his theme, makes
an interesting program:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A king who has a lofty ideal of society
wishes to lead his subjects up to it by his
methods of government, and is willing to
abdicate when he feels that they are really
free. His chief instruments in the work
of redemption are doctors and school teachers.
On the one hand freedom, on the other
action. Freedom from error whilst doing
everything to favor and afford sufficient
light. A tendency to abolish all forms of
restraint, from the material ones for criminals
to the moral ones for all men; from
handcuffs to laws. The gradual abolition
of hereditary rights of property; every human
being to have the needful, and everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
to return to a common fund at his
death. The legal personality of women, and
the equality of the sexes, to be recognized
as steps to the conquest of individuality,
liberty, happiness. Each to be free to develop
to the utmost his own life, his own
affections. Birth and education to be protected.
Rest to be ensured to old age. Public
hygiene to be watched over till disease
be eliminated. Every facility to be afforded
to manufactures, commerce and science, so
as to encourage man to conquer himself, the
earth, the heavens. Faith in progress, as if
it were not,&mdash;and it is not,&mdash;destined to die
with our earth. The worship of life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a scheme and the style and force
of the book are difficult to associate with
the neurasthenic proofreader, skilfully as
the author has drawn the background and
made the man's thought develop over his
proof table.</p>

<p>But whether the character be drawn
convincingly or not, the book gives a
wonderfully clear and sharp-cut picture
of the environment of such a worker.
Some bits of description stand out above
the others, one of them the Turin tenement,
where "from the first flights of
stairs, carpeted and warmed by hot air
pipes, to the bare flight of our top floor,
the steps grew ever steeper and steeper.
Each evening we passed through all the
social zones, hot, temperate and cold;
we were lodged in the arctic regions."
There were 142 of these steps to the top
floor, where naught but poverty dwelt,&mdash;a
penniless poet with a sister who supported
him, a lonely working girl, a
woman of the streets, a drunkard and his
screaming, beaten wife and half-witted
children, and Cimisin, a cobbler, who always
"was whistling at full speed to the
accompaniment of his hammer. The tears
of women, the curses of drunkards, had
for so many years mingled with the merriment
of that harmless madman."</p>

<p>His history of the printing shop is complete
and modern, even to the point where
the men went back to their cases after a
strike, only to find that long rows of linotypes
with women operators had displaced
them. These women, he thought, might
have among them one fitted to be his
mate, but he was too shy to seek her out.
He could see them only as workers at
the almost human machines, or where
"the cylinders revolved with a loud din,
the sheets rained out one on top of the
other, the women in their long overalls
kept on repeating their monotonous movements,
feeding the sheets into the press
or collecting them into piles. On two
side platforms the women were in constant
motion. A hundred women and a
hundred men. It was impossible to imagine
that relations other than those existing
between the several parts of a machine
might be formed between these beings
created for a mutual understanding."
Still he wonders vaguely if</p>

<blockquote>

<p>perhaps in this uniformity of action, foreign
to and apart from the monotonous toil
which exhausts them, something exists,
smiles, shines? Have some got a small
bird singing in their hearts whilst their
hands grow grimy at the wheel?...
No love of their work,&mdash;that is to say of their
life,&mdash;inspired them; each of them constantly
saw the work of an hour, a mere fragment,
leave his hands anonymously and forever,
and none of them could ever say of
anything, "That is my work!" What will remain
of them at the end of their lives to
prove that they have lived? In truth, they
have not lived.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the women in his tenement, girls
who were not harnessed to a factory, he
found even less of life, though perhaps
more of womanhood. Going with his
friend to see the latter's young sister in
a maternity hospital, he reflects that this
is the way with many of them,&mdash;"love
leads to the hospital." The patients there
are mostly unmarried girls. The married
ones have few children now. "How talk
of love, of family life, in a society which
deals out the same ration to the single
man and to the father of a family?"</p>

<p>His friend starves, the sister dies, the
drunkard's wife, mother of six, takes her
life,&mdash;everyone whom he knew, it seems,
all the associates high up in the attic of
the "a&euml;ropolis," come to grief and misery
and death. He greatly admires the
woman, a physician, who visits them.
"She picks up, joins, straightens out innumerable
threads; she seems to be weaving
a tapestry of which she will only
complete a tiny bit, a work which she
has inherited from one generation and
will transmit to another." She offers him
a part in her work, but he feels "incapable
of giving myself in small doses." He
is impatient, irritable for "something
ready to hand, swift as lightning," that
shall right all wrongs and ease all pain
at a stroke. He cannot work with others,
or for others, and so he tucks his story
into his bosom and starts out to meet the
King's car. Almost at the last he confesses,
"I have passed beside life."</p>


<h3>SCHOOL REPORTS<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>

<p class="right">Reviewed by ROLAND P. FALKNER</p>

<p>To the great majority of people the
school report is the only tangible evidence
of what the school administration is doing.
The citizens generally cannot be
expected to know what goes on in the
school rooms or in the meetings of boards
of education, nor what is taking shape
in the back of the superintendent's head.
Even were they afforded the utmost opportunity
and gifted with such unusual
perception, it is not likely that without
convenient summaries and condensed
statements they could form any idea of
the public school system as a whole.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> School Reports and School Efficiency by David S.
Snedden and William H. Allen for the New York Committee
on the Physical Welfare of School Children.
New York, 1908. Pp. 183. This book will be sent by
<span class="smcap">Charities and The Commons</span> postpaid for $1.50.</p></div>

<p>If the school report is at once the evidence
and test of the school administration,
it is clear that its ideal is such a
marshalling of the facts regarding the
schools of the city as will give the reasonably
intelligent citizen a clear notion of
just how well the schools are performing
the duties entrusted to them.</p>

<p>The book before us is a study of the
school reports for the purpose of ascertaining
how far and in what manner they
seek to embody such ideal. It is a study
in comparative administration.</p>

<p>This study reveals so wide a diversity
among school reports as to preclude the
idea of any consensus of opinion as to
what they should contain. While uniformity
of scope and treatment is not to
be expected, it might reasonably be anticipated
that the similar purposes of the
school administration in different places
would give to these reports a certain
family resemblance. In so far as such a
resemblance can be traced, it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>appear to be so much the result of parallel
internal development as the product of external
compulsion or suggestion. State
educational departments charged with
allotment of state school funds according
to a fixed unit in school work, have
led to an emphasis upon such units. A
similar influence has been exerted by the
United States Bureau of Education in
its request for information along certain
definite lines.</p>

<p>Apart from these influences tending toward
a certain uniformity, there are other
forces working in the same direction
though less effectively. The trend of
present discussion in educational affairs
is not without its influence, and when
certain facts are needed to point a moral
or adorn a tale the experience of other
cities points to investigations or arrangements
of material which are new to the
city in question. Conscious effort to
promote uniform treatment of statistical
data, a theme which has been discussed
almost to weariness by the National Education
Association and kindred organizations,
has been singularly fruitless.</p>

<p>With these general considerations by
way of introduction, the work takes up
its main theme, the scope of educational
statistics. In them we find the condensation
of educational experience, and here
more than in other parts of the text we
should expect the experience and practice
of one city to be helpful to another.
Too often, indeed almost universally, the
tables of facts are isolated from the text
of the report, and no effort is made to
explain their meaning or set forth the salient
features which they present. In
view of the volume of tabular matter
there is a painful poverty of interpretation.</p>

<p>The method pursued by the author in
his record of the facts, is to furnish a
specimen table from the different reports
in regard to each matter touched
upon, a selection of the simpler and then
the more detailed statements to be found
in them. The following heads are treated
in this way: School plant, expenditure,
census, attendance, age of pupils, promotions,
survival, compulsory attendance,
high schools, vacation schools, libraries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
medical inspection, teachers and summaries.
The variety of forms exhibited
is highly instructive although, it may be
confessed, somewhat bewildering. The
author has confined himself so strictly to
a study of methods that he is disposed to
let the tables speak for themselves. There
is here, too, an absence of interpretation.
Tables of figures may speak for themselves
but to understand them one must
know their language. One cannot help
but feel that in many cases some explanation
why the detailed tables are to be regarded
as superior, other than the fact
that they are more detailed, would have
been more illuminating and would have
relieved somewhat the monotony of this
important chapter for the general reader.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to outline a model
report. We have instead in chapter 5 a
series of questions which might be answered
in a school report. The list does
not pretend to be exhaustive but in reality
it constitutes a somewhat formidable
program, if it be assumed that the greater
part of these questions should receive
attention.</p>

<p>Conscious of the fact that somewhat
staggering demands are made on the
school administration, the discussion of
"suggested economies and improvement"
comes as an antidote. This is a brief
discussion of short cuts and methods to
get at desired results. It looks to a simplification
of records and such forms and
registers as will supply the needed information,
without excessive work. This
is a very vital point and the suggestions
as far as they go are admirable.</p>

<p>While the subject presented in these
pages is thoroughly technical, the work
may be commended most heartily to
school authorities and to all who are interested
in the progress of our schools.
It is an appeal for exact information and
should not be passed by without a hearing.
Such information in regard to our
schools,&mdash;one of the most important
branches of our government,&mdash;is painfully
lacking. It has too often been assumed
that the management of schools
was a matter for experts of which outsiders
could not properly judge. Within
certain limits this is true, but it does not
distinguish between the scholastic and the
administrative sides of school work. We
undoubtedly need both among our school
authorities, and in the public at large a
keener perception of the requisites of a
sound and effective administration. It is
not, perhaps, too much to say that there
is no great business enterprise of the people
of which they know so little as they
do of their schools. In private affairs
such ignorance on the part of directors
and stockholders would lead to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The authorship of the several chapters
of the book is distinctly stated. The general
considerations herein briefly noted
are the work of Dr. Snedden; the particular
application to the city of New York
is the work of Dr. Allen. Those who are
familiar with Dr. Allen's work answer
that he can always be relied upon for a
readable and spicy statement. But in
view of the predominantly local interest
of his discussion and the inexorable limits
of space, it has seemed best in the foregoing
notice to lay the greater emphasis
on those large aspects of the subject
which are from the pen of Dr. Snedden.</p>

<p>Engineers have a simple process by
which in half an hour's time they strike
off a "blue print" from a drawing into
which has gone the imagination of a procession
of midnights, and the exacting
work of a vast company of days.</p>

<p>God and man and nature,&mdash;whosoever
you will,&mdash;have draughted a mighty and
irregular industrial community at the
headwaters of the Ohio; they have
splashed, as Kipling puts it, at a ten
league canvas with brushes of comet's
hair. Under the name of the Pittsburgh
Survey, Charities Publication Committee
has carried on a group of social investigations
in this great steel district. In a
sense, we have been blue-printing Pittsburgh.
Our findings will be published
in a series of special numbers of which
this is the first, covering in order:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I. The People;<br />
&nbsp;II. The Place;<br />
III. The Work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Full reports are to be published later
in a series of volumes by the Russell Sage
Foundation and, throughout, the text will
be reinforced with such photographs, pastels,
maps, charts, diagrams and tables
as will help give substance and reality
to our presentations of fact.</p>

<p>In this sense, then, it is a blue print
of Pittsburgh, that we attempt. At least
the analogy of the draughting room may
make it clear that the work, as we conceive
it, lies, like the blue print, within
modest outlay and reasonable human
compass. Our presentation must frankly
lack the mechanical fidelity and inclusiveness
of the engineer's negative;
but we can endeavor to bring out in relief
the organic truth of the situation by
giving body and living color, as we see
them, to what would otherwise be but
the thin white tracings of a town.</p>

<p>Occasional articles have been published
during the year, but the results of the
Survey are put forward for the first time
as a consecutive whole in the pages that
follow. Here is the place, then, for a
simple statement of the drive and scope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
of the work as conceived by those who
have carried it forward:</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Survey has been a
rapid, close range investigation of living
conditions in the Pennsylvania steel district.
It has been carried on by a special
staff organized under the national publication
committee which prints this magazine.
It has been financed chiefly by
three grants, of moderate amount, from
the Russell Sage Foundation for the Improvement
of Living Conditions. It has
been made practicable by co-operation
from two quarters,&mdash;from a remarkable
group of leaders and organizations in social
and sanitary movements in different
parts of the United States, who entered
upon the field work as a piece of national
good citizenship; and from men, women
and organizations in Pittsburgh who
were large-minded enough to regard
their local situation as not private and peculiar,
but a part of the American problem
of city building.</p>

<p>The outcome has been a spirited piece
of inter-state co-operation in getting at
the urban fact in a new way. For consider
what has already been done in this
field in America. We have counted our
city populations regularly every ten years,&mdash;in
some states every five. We have
known that the country has grown and
spread out stupendously within the century,
and that within that period our cities
have spread out and filled up with
even greater resistlessness. How goes it
with them? What more do we know?
True, we have profited by incisive analyses
of one factor or another which enters
into social well-being,&mdash;tuberculosis,
factory legislation, infant mortality, public
education, to name examples; and we
have heard the needs of particular neighborhoods
described by those who know
them. But there is something further,
synthetic and clarifying, to be gained
by a sizing up process that reckons at
once with many factors in the life of a
great civic area, not going deeply into all
subjects, but offering a structural exhibit
of the community as a going concern.
This is what the examining physician demands
before he accepts us as an insurance
risk, what a modern farmer puts his
soils and stock through before he plants
his crops, what the consulting electrician
performs as his first work when he is
called in to overhaul a manufacturing
plant. And this, in the large, has been
the commission undertaken by the Pittsburgh
Survey.</p>

<p>The main work was set under way in
September, 1907, when a company of
men and women of established reputation
as students of social and industrial problems,
spent the month in Pittsburgh. On
the basis of their diagnosis, a series of
specialized investigations was projected
along a few of the lines which promised
significant results. The staff has included
not only trained investigators but also
representatives of the different races who
make up so large a share of the working
population dealt with. Limitations of
time and money set definite bounds to the
work, which will become clear as the findings
are presented. The experimental
nature of the undertaking, and the unfavorable
trade conditions which during
the past year have reacted upon economic
life in all its phases, have set other limits.
Our inquiries have dealt with the wage-earners
of Pittsburgh (a) in their relation
to the community as a whole, and
(b) in their relation to industry. Under
the former we have studied the genesis
and racial make-up of the population; its
physical setting and its social institutions;
under the latter we have studied the general
labor situation; hours, wages, and
labor control in the steel industry; child
labor, industrial education, women in industry,
the cost of living, and industrial
accidents.</p>

<p>From the first, the work of the investigations
has been directed to the service
of local movements for improvement.
For, as stated in a mid-year announcement
of the Survey, we have been studying
the community at a time when nascent
social forces are asserting themselves.
Witness the election of an independent
mayor three years ago, and Mr. Guthrie's
present fight to clear councils of graft.
Within the field of the Survey and within
one year, the Pittsburgh Associated Charities
has been organized; the force of
tenement inspectors has been doubled and
has carried out a first general housing
census, and a scientific inquiry, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
name of the Pittsburgh Typhoid Commission,
has been instituted into the disease
which has been endemic in the district for
over a quarter of a century. A civic improvement
commission, representative in
membership and perhaps broader in scope
than any similar body in the country, is
now in process of formation.</p>

<p>A display of wall maps, enlarged photographs,
housing plans, and other graphic
material was the chief feature of a civic
exhibit held in Carnegie Institute in
November and December, following the
joint conventions in Pittsburgh of the
American Civic Association and the National
Municipal League. The local
civic bearings of the Survey were the
subject of the opening session of these
conventions. Its economic aspects were
brought forward at a joint session of the
American Economic Association and the
American Sociological Society at Atlantic
City in December.</p>

</div>

<p>The present issue is frankly introductory.
It deals with the city as a community
of people. Pittsburgh is usually
defined in other terms. First among
American cities in the production of iron
and steel, we are told that it ranks fifth
as a general manufacturing center. There
are forty-seven furnaces within forty
miles of the heart of the city, with an
annual capacity of over seven million
tons of pig iron,&mdash;more than twenty-five
per cent of the total production in the
United States. Statistics of the American
iron trade for 1907 show that Allegheny
county produced a fourth of all
Bessemer steel and a third of all open
hearth steel, a fifth of all rails rolled in
the United States, a third of all plates and
sheets, and very nearly a half of all structural
shapes. Pittsburgh proper ranked
fourth in foundry and machine shop products,
second in brick and tile, pottery
and fire clay, and first in electrical apparatus
and supplies. In coal and coke,
tin plate, glass, cork, and sheet metal,&mdash;in
products as varied as the fifty-seven
varieties of the pickles in which it excels,&mdash;its
output is a national asset. Pittsburgh
stands tenth in postal receipts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
fifth in bank deposits. Its banking capital
exceeds that of the banks of the North
Sea empires and its payroll that of whole
groups of American states. Here is a
town, then, big with its works.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, there is a temptation to define
Pittsburgh in terms of the matrix in
which the community is set, and the impress
of this matrix on the soul of its
people no less than on the senses of the
visitor. Pipe lines that carry oil and
gas, waterways that float an acreage of
coal barges, four track rails worn bright
with weighty ore cars, wires surcharged
with a ruthless voltage or delicately sensitive
to speech and codes, bind here a
district of vast natural resources into one
organic whole. The approaching traveller
has ample warning. Hillsides and
valleys are seamed with rows of coke
ovens, gaunt tipples bend above mine
mouths, derricks and bull-wheels stand
over fuel wells, and low lying mill buildings,
sided with corrugated iron, rear
their clusters of stacks like the pipes of
huge swarthy Pans. Then comes the
city with its half-conquered smoke cloud,
with its high, bare hills and its hunch of
imposing structures. The place to see
Pittsburgh from is a much whittled little
stand on the high bluff of Mt. Washington,
where votaries of the national game
assemble on a clear afternoon and
spy upon a patch of green in Allegheny
City, hundreds of feet below them, and
more than a mile
away across the
Ohio River.
Their business
is with Honus
Wagner and the
three-bagger he
is going to
knock out. But
yours can be
with the great Y
of the rivers,
churned by
stern-wheeled
steamers and
patched here and
there with black
fleets of coal
barges. Below
you to the right is the South Side; to the
left across the rivers, is Allegheny City,
and between them is a little trowel of land
piled high with office buildings. This is
the "Point," cut short as it is by the
"Hump" and by higher hills behind; and
flanked by narrow river banks that
grudge a foothold to the sounding workshops
and lead up and down to the mill
towns. You are looking at commercial
Pittsburgh. From the Herron Hill reservoir,
mid-way between the forks of the
Y, you get a panorama of the other side
of the community,&mdash;Shenley Park to the
right of you, with the Carnegie buildings
and the ample residences of the East End,
and to the left, long swales of small,
thickly built houses that make up Lawrenceville
and the adjoining home areas.</p>

<p>But it is at night that the red and
black of the Pittsburgh flag marks the
town for its own. The lines of coke
ovens seen from the car windows have
become huge scythes, saw-edged with
fire. The iron-sheathed mills are crated
flame. Great fans of light and shadow
wig-wag above furnaces and converters.
From Cliff street, the lamps of Allegheny
lie thick and clustered like a
crushed sky, but from the bridges that
span the Monongahela between the
mills,&mdash;where choleric trains shuttle on
either bank, and the rolls are at thumping
war with the sliding, red billets,&mdash;the
water welds the sparks and the yellow tumult,
and you feel as if here were the
forges of the sunrise, where beam and
span and glowing plate are fabricating
into the framework of dawns that shall
"come up like thunder." Here,&mdash;if we
doubted it before,&mdash;is a town that works;
and that works in a big way.</p>

<p>But the people, rather than the product
or the setting, concern us. In December,
1907, Pittsburgh and Allegheny
were merged, and the Greater City entered
the class of Baltimore, St. Louis
and Boston. This is the half-million
class. Last September, Pittsburgh celebrated
its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary,
and a street pageant exhibited
both the industrial vigor of the community,
and the variety of its people. There
was a company of Corn Planter Indians,
descendants of the aboriginal Pittsburghers;
there were floats representing the
early settlers; there were Scotchmen with
kilts and bagpipes; nor were they all. A
wagon load of Italians bore a transparency,&mdash;"Romans
dig your sewers," and
Polish, Slovak and other racial organizations
marched in the costumes of their
native countries. For the life of the city
has become intricate and rich in the picturesque.
That old man you passed on
the street was a Morgan raider, and behind
him trudged a common soldier of
the Japanese War. Here is an American
whose Pittsburgh is the marble corridors
of an office building, and the night desks
of the men in shirt sleeves and green
eye shades; and here, one whose Pittsburgh
reaches back to a stately old parlor
with gilt-framed mirrors and spindling
Chippendale. Here is "Belle," who exchanges
her winter in the workhouse for
a summer in a jon-boat, which she reaches
by a plank. Here is the <i>gazda</i> who ruined
himself that his boarders might not
starve. And here, the inventor who works
with many men in a great laboratory and
scraps a thousand dollars' worth of experimentation
at the turn of a hand.
Here is a gallery of miners pounding
their grimy fists at a speech by Haywood
in the old town hall; and here a bunch of
half-sobered Slavs in the Sunday morning
police court.</p>

<p>You do not know the Pittsburgh District<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
until you have heard the Italians
twanging their mandolins round a construction
campfire, and seen the mad
whirling of a Slovak dance in a mill town
lodge hall; until you have watched the
mill hands burst out from the gates at
closing time; or thrown confetti on Fifth
avenue on a Halloween. Within a few
blocks of the skyscrapers of the Point, I
have seen a company of Syrians weaving
almost unceasingly for four days a desert
dance that celebrated the return of
one of them to Jerusalem. (An Irishman
thought it a wake.) A possum
swings by the tail at Christmastide in
front of that Negro store in Wylie avenue;
long bearded Old Believers play
bottle pool in that Second avenue barroom;
a Yiddish father and five children
lie sick on the floor of this tenement;
this old Bohemian woman cleaned molds
as a girl in the iron works of Prague;
that itinerant cobbler made shoes last
winter for the German children of the
South Side, who were too poor to pay
for them, and stuffed the soles with thick
cardboard when he was too poor to buy
leather. Here is a Scotch Calvinist, and
there a Slavic free thinker; here a peasant,
and there a man who works from a
blue print; engineers, drag outs, and
furnace-men from the mill district; yeggs
and floppers and '69ers from the lower
reaches of the city; strippers and core
makers and coffin buffers. There a Russian
exile with a price on his head, and
here a Shaker of old Pennsylvania stock!
You have heard of Shakespeare's London,
of the port of Lisbon in the days of
the Spanish Main, of the mixtures of
caste and race and faith on the trade
routes of the East. They are of the ilk
of Pittsburgh. How to get orderly plans
of social betterment out of the study of
such a community is at first sight a staggering
question. But the clue to its answer
is that same fact that stood out
when we looked at Pittsburgh as a city
of tonnage and incandescence. These
people are here to work. This fact once
grasped in its bearings and we get a foothold
for estimating Pittsburgh. The
wage earners become a fairly well-defined
belt in the population. What the issues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
of life and labor mean to them will help
us in understanding the trend of conditions
in industrial communities generally.</p>

<p>First, you have the mere fact of aggregation.
Pittsburgh has as many people
as the whole state of Pennsylvania had
at the opening of the last century; Allegheny
county as many as at that time the
commonwealths of Massachusetts and
New York combined. The Greater City
has twice as many as all the future cities
of the United States had in 1800; as
many as Baltimore, Boston, Chicago,
Philadelphia, St. Louis, combined, in
1850. Here, then, is a community worthy
of as serious statesmanship as that
which has served whole commonwealths
at critical periods in our national advance.
Now in all history, cities have
never reproduced themselves. They draw
on the country districts to replace the
stock that they burn out. But when one-third
of the total population comes to live
in cities, they can no longer do this. It
becomes vitally important that city people
live well, else the race lapses. At risk,
then, of going over old ground, let us
look at some of the dynamic influences
that affect the life of this particular community.</p>

<p>No American city presents in a
more clear-cut way than Pittsburgh the
abrupt change from British and Teutonic
immigration. Sociologists tell us that in
the mid-eastern valleys of Europe successive
waves of broad-headed, long-headed,
dark and fair peoples gathered
force and swept westward to become Kelt
and Saxon and Swiss and Scandinavian
and Teuton. They were the bulwark
which obstructed the march of Hun and
Goth and Turk and Tartar, sweeping in
from the East. It is from Slavs and
mixed people of this old midland, with
racial and religious loves and hates
seared deep, that the new immigration
is coming to Pittsburgh to work out
civilization under tense conditions. A
vineyard blighted, a pogrom, torture,
persecution, crime, poverty, dislodge
them, and they come.</p>

<p>Further, the sociologists tell us that by
mixed peoples the greatest advances have
been made. It was in Amsterdam, Venice,
London, and the Hanse towns, places
of mart which brought together the blood
and cultures of distant races,&mdash;it was
here that democracy gathered head and
the arts flourished. But in Pittsburgh
are the elements of a mixture yet more
marvelous. A common fund of Slavic
words, almost a Pittsburgh dialect, is
finding currency. The Pole still speaks
Polish, but he makes an adaptation of his
words, and the Slovak understands. The
Syrian and Arabian peddlers know these
words and use them in selling their wares
in the courts and settlements,&mdash;a contrast
to the great gulfs that still separate the
Slav and the English-speaking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the city is the frontier of
to-day. We have appropriated and parcelled
out most of our free land. The
edge of settlement is no longer open as
a safety valve for foot-loose rebels against
the fixity of things. They come to the
cities. They swarm in new hives. To
Pittsburgh especially where men deal
with devil-may-care risks and great
stakes, come the adventurous and the
unreckoning. A smack of the mining
camp is in the air about the mill yards.</p>

<p>The life to which these people come is
different from that known of any previous
generations. We have seen how
in Pittsburgh traction lines, tunnels, inclines,
telephone wires, weave a city of a
size and on a site which would have been
impossible in the old days. The householder
is far removed from the sources
of his food supply. He lives two or
three families deep and many to the acre.
The very aggregation of people breeds
disease, a complication which in turn may
yet be balanced by those revolutions in
medical science which have brought glad,
new optimism to sanitarian and physician.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p>The work to which these people come
is not the work of their fathers. The
discipline of the mill is not the discipline
of the field. Human nature is put
to new and exacting tests. It works unremittingly
as it has not worked before,&mdash;eight,
ten, twelve hours a day, seven
days in the week, with the chance of
twenty-four hours once in the fortnight.
It works by artificial light and at night.
It works in great plants and creates and
puts together in fierce new ways. Of
that growing share of the population of
Pittsburgh which is continental born, a
large proportion is from the country and
small villages. This is no less true of
the influx of southern Negroes,&mdash;a north-bound
movement here and in other cities,
the final outcome of which we do
not know. The newcomers, it is true,
may be groomed in passage. A railroad
may open up a Hungarian back country
and the peasant get his first training
there; a Ruthenian may work on the
plantations and sugar beet factories of
Bessarabia before coming on; a southern
Negro may hire out in the mills of Alabama
before starting north; or a Slovak
may work as a slate picker or miner's
helper in the anthracite fields on his way
westward. The drift through it all none
the less is from field to mill.</p>

<p>New stock, then, a mixed people, venturesome,
country-bred,&mdash;so much the sociologist
has pointed out to us; the economist
has other things to tell. He sees
about him the potent aftermath of those
great changes from household and domestic
forms of production to the factory
system. As each new peasantry
leaves the soil, the history of the industrial
revolution is repeated, but processes
are accelerated and the experience of a
generation is taken at a jump. With this
has occurred a great lateral stratification
of industry. There is no longer the feudal
loyalty to a particular concern, but
to the men of a particular trade. Unions
have sprung up, and have grown or
broken. The thing above all others
which has tended in Pittsburgh to
their undoing in certain great trades
has been the subdivision of labor.
The flea on the hair of the tail
of the dog of the wild man of Borneo
just come to town, is an entity large and
complete compared with the processes
which occupy many men in the electrical
works and car shops. This change has
multiplied product, and set unskilled labor
to busy itself at a thousand stints;
but it has fore-shortened trade knowledge
and ousted much craftsmanship. Along
with it has come another physical change.
The skilled men of the old time hammers
and anvils work with electric cranes and
at continuous processes that reach from
the heat of great ovens and the jaws of
soaking pits to the piled and finished
product. An intricate dovetailing of flagmen,
brakemen, engineers and train despatchers
makes up a train to carry huge
dynamos and steel structural shapes
across the continent. This fact has a
new and vital social significance. Its essence
is team play. Its reactions upon
the psychology of associated effort have
yet to be explored. Once again, new
and unheard of crafts are ushered in, to
engage their quota of the time and
strength of the working force, and to
put it to new tests of adaptability. Take
the implications of the steel industry
itself, in the building trades. The old
time carpenter and builder gives way to
the house-smith and the structural steel
worker.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<p>In Pittsburgh, too, we have a stupendous
example of the influence upon the
wage earners' city of a mighty fiscal
change in industry, combining in one corporation
all processes from the ore to the
completed bridge. Work is organized
nationally. The steel center like the mill
town is not a thing by itself. It is a step
in a bigger process managed from without
and owned by a multitude of nonresident
stockholders. Pittsburgh must
build up an active, native citizenship or
be merely an industrial department. The
community and the workshop are at issue.</p>

<p>Finally,&mdash;in our roster of dominating
influences,&mdash;within the last twenty-five
years, has come the invasion of women
into industry. This is not a simple thing,
nor a little one. It can directly affect
half the population. Pittsburgh is not
primarily a woman's town, yet 22,000
women engage in the trades, and each
year they invade a new department.
These women workers are affected by all
the forces noted and in turn affect and
complicate those forces.</p>

<p>These are some of the dominant influences
that affect wage-earners in cities
assembled. One element runs through
their complications and brings us clear-seeing
and hope. It is the element
of change and flow. In the Royal
Museum at Munich are the miniatures
of a group of medieval towns carved
out of wood. The spires of the churches,
the walls and gates of the city, markets,
houses, outbuildings and gardens
are reproduced with a fidelity that
has stood these centuries. They embody
the old idea of a town, of the fixity
of things. A man was his father's son.
He worked as his father worked. He
was burgher, or freeman, or serf as his
father was burgher, or freeman, or serf.
His looms and his spinning wheels and
vats were as his fathers had contrived
them. He lived in the house of his father
as his father had lived and it served
him well. Pittsburgh is the antithesis of
such a town. It is all motion. The modern
industrial city is a flow, not a tank.
The important thing is not the capacity
of a town, but the volume and currents
of its life and, by gauging these, we can
gauge the community. We must gauge
at the intake,&mdash;the children, the immigrant,
the countrymen who come in;
gauge at the outlets; and gauge at the
stages in the course of the working life.
If there be unnecessary death, if strong
field hands are crippled or diseased
through their manner of living or working,
if the twelve hour man sees everything
gray before his eyes in the morning,
if women work in new ways that cost
their strength or the strength of their
young, if school children are drafted off
as laborers before they are fit; if boys
grow into manhood without training for
the trades of this generation,&mdash;then we
have a problem in social hydraulics to
deal with. We must put old social institutions
and usages to the test of these
changing tides. Herein lies the essence
of constructive philanthropy. In this
light, tenement house legislation is no
more than an adaptation of domestic necessities
and customs to the difficulties
of living three stories deep, and factory
acts no more than an effort to work out
the law of skull crackers, freight yards,
and electrically driven mines. We have
to fashion a city not alone for the hereditary
householder, but for the mobile and
transient and half-assimilated, for workers
with multiple tools and above all for
people on an upward trend.</p>

<p>Faced with its great task of production,
Pittsburgh has not set itself to the thrift
of self-knowledge. When half a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
people were dying each year from
typhoid fever, the movement to clear the
water supply was blocked and exploited
at every turn. Half a thousand workmen
are now killed each year in the industries
of Allegheny county, and yet the public
has not taken the trouble to sift the accidents
through and see which can be prevented.
Nobody knows how many men
are seriously injured every year; nobody
knows how many men and women are beset
with trade diseases. Nobody knows
how much the community is paying for
such wastes as these. Nobody knows
how far the seeping off of human integers
into hospitals, and jails, insane
asylums, brothels, and orphanages, could
be checked; the guesses of the town's best
men are that much is needless. Pittsburgh
is a town which does not know the
number of its children of school age, nor,
the physical status of the children of its
classes; it is a town which, for five years,
did not so much as demand a report from
its health department. In such an arraignment,
we must bear in mind that
there are notable exceptions in one phase
of social concern or another to this lack
in Pittsburgh's self-knowledge, and that
Pittsburgh is not merely a scapegoat city.
It is the capital of a district representative
of untrammeled industrial development,
but of a district which, for richer, for
poorer, in sickness and in health, for
vigor, waste and optimism, is rampantly
American.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Survey has been carried
out with such a working conception
of the field it had before it. We have
brought to one city people of special experience
in others, to gauge its needs.
We have measured its institutions against
standards worked out in this city or in
that, or in other local enterprises; and
we have estimated civic and industrial
conditions by their effect on groups of
individual families. In the present issue
we put forward the composite situation
as reflected in the lives of two
groups&mdash;the immigrant and the Negro.
Later issues will go into the social bearings
of courts and schools, hospitals,
houses and factories. But such individual
problems have no reality unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
seen in their human relations and for
this reason, this issue begins with an interpretation
of the genesis of the community
by a native Pittsburgher, who
has become one of the civic leaders of
New England. We have an estimate of
new immigration by a Welshman from
the Anthracite region, who is representative
of the old, and an estimate
of his fellows by one of the Slavs. The
outlook of the steel mill worker is appraised
by a man whose eyes have
known the broad sweep of prairies of
the American Northwest. A description
of the working women whose hours and
wages and conditions of employment will
next concern us, and of the families into
whose lives come the tragedies of industrial
accidents, are included. And
finally, the issues of life in a representative
mill town are put forth, standing
out more isolated and clear cut for
the purposes of analysis than it is possible
to find them in the more intricate
operations of the Greater City.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of my earliest recollections of a
canvas covered geography is the prime
fact which is Pittsburgh,&mdash;that here the
Allegheny and Monongahela rivers unite
to form the Ohio. Huge economic
foundations buttress this fact (oil and
gas and clay and iron and coal). History
in the making has rolled it into new
shapes and a changing significance. The
junction is the great left fist of the
Father of Waters. The three rivers
give the town common cause and intercourse
with the Atlantic coast ranges to
the east, and the mid-continental bottom
lands, north and south, to the west.
Their waters carry the ores and fill the
boilers and douse the hissing billets of
the steel makers. They are not easy
overlords, this triumvirate of rivers.
They carry fever which scotches one
town and the next. They rise a bit
too far and the fires are out, the streets
flooded. But grudgingly and inevitably,
they yield mastery. They are dammed
and sluiced and boiled and filtered to
suit the demands of navigation and
power and temperature and thirst.</p>

<p>The mastery they yield is to another
current&mdash;the eddying peoples which
make up the community and all its works&mdash;a
current more powerful and mysterious
than the bulk of brown waters. The
War Department engineers can tell you
the exact number of cubic feet which
slide past either side of the Point every
minute. The sanitarians can give you
the number of bacteria, friendly or
plague-besetting, which infect any cubic
centimeter. The weather man in a high
building can forecast the exact stage
which the water will register hours
hence. But what of the people?&mdash;they
have largely taken themselves for granted.
They have rarely taken the time to
test their own needs or consciously
gauge the destination of the currents
that possess them. They are here&mdash;the
strong, the weak, the cowed, the ambitious,
the well equipped and the pitiful.
They jostle and work and breed. For
the most part they run a splendid course.
But they do not keep tally, and their ignorance
means sorrow and death and
misunderstanding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To give a little help to those who are
trying to understand, and measure these
currents, and deal with them as intelligently
as the locks and channels of the
rivers are dealt with, has been the purpose
of the Pittsburgh Survey. Such
chartings as we have attempted have been
of these living waters.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh has always been unique
among American towns. Known as the
dingy capital of a "black country," during
all but the latest period of its growth
it has attracted few visitors save those
whose business motive brought them.
The nucleus of its population is different
from that of any other of our large
centers. Its situation at the gateway of
the Middle West was sure to bring it
into significance as the center of the country's
population and activity shifted, but
the Allegheny mountains were for a
long time a barrier against the easy
movement of population in this direction.
It is the varied mineral resources
of western Pennsylvania, and the pertinacity
of the chief element among its
inhabitants in developing them, which
has created a new metropolitan district,
having virtually a population of a million,
to be added to the seven or eight
urban centers which now dominate different
sections of the United States.</p>

<p>Beginning as a little hamlet about the
fortifications used first by the French,
then by the English, at the junction
where the Allegheny and Monongahela
rivers form the Ohio, the settlement developed
from a trading post to a market
town. It would have been limited to
the career of such a place much longer
if, in spite of the excellent soil of the
surrounding region, the farmers had not
found it difficult to compete in the matter
of the staple crops with the slave-tilled
plantations of the South. It was
as a sort of forced alternative that small
iron-working plants began to spring up
along the rivers. The ore was brought
down from the Alleghenies. Bituminous
coal,&mdash;the distinguishing asset of the
coming industrial center,&mdash;had already
been discovered by the French in the
river valleys.</p>

<p>The "town beyond the mountains"
again found itself embarrassed in marketing
its commodities,&mdash;not by competition
this time, so far as America was
concerned, but by the heights over which
its ponderous new output must be carried.
This obstacle was overcome by a
system of canals with inclined cable portage
lines up the mountain slopes. Meanwhile
the great trade with the West for
the supply of its incipient civilization was
being established through the river traffic
as well as by newly dug canals.</p>

<p>Some of the first citizens of the town
after the revolutionary days were naturally
men who had been prominently engaged
in the war. Two of them were
Irishmen who had leaped to the opportunity
to fight England. At the close of
hostilities they had foresight to discern
that large developments were to come
at the juncture of the rivers. The descendants
of these men,&mdash;some of whom
by a curious irony are English and have
never seen this country,&mdash;are at the
present moment the greatest holders of
Pittsburgh real estate. The great bulk
of the early immigrants into the town
were Scotch-Irish, who began to come in
large numbers early in the nineteenth
century, and almost two generations before
the inrush of the southern Irish.
Until recent great developments, when
the skyscrapers began to appear, the
older part of the city in its aspect was
distinctly suggestive of British towns of
the same size and character. Two of its
local sections were very naturally called
Birmingham and Manchester, names
which have almost passed out of use
among the American born generations.
The manners and customs of the people
showed about equally the traces of pioneer
days in the Ohio valley and the traditions
of the old country. Unlike the
large cities that have grown up along
the Great Lakes, Pittsburgh owes nothing
to successive waves of migration
from New England. It is only in very
recent years, with the varied developments
of technical and educational interests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
that there have been enough
New Englanders living in the city to develop
any of the organized front which
they maintain in all other northern cities.
It is natural therefore that, though Pittsburgh
was strongly loyal for the union
during the Civil War, the spirit of the
city should in many respects suggest the
South rather than the North.</p>

<p>Around the nucleus of Scotch-Irish,
gathered, as time went on, large numbers
of southern Irish, Scotch, Welsh,
Germans and German Jews. But these
different types are still to a noticeable
degree always considered as being
marked off by themselves as against
the dominant Scotch-Irish. It is only
as individuals from among them
gain a position of influence by special
achievement that they are considered a
part of the bone and sinew of the city.
The Scotch-Irish with their contrasted
traits of sturdiness and ardor, have two
great separate interests in life,&mdash;industry
and religion. The other nationalities
have either had the same traits in good
measure, or by process of selection individuals
have caught the spirit and have
come to the front while the rest have
fallen to the rear. Yet those who fell
back have in most cases found a reasonable
opportunity in the great material
progress of the town.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh is all the more characteristically
American for having been built
up from first to last by immigrant stock,
not merely by unsettled natives. It remains
to this day a sort of natural selection
of enterprising spirits from out of
every European nation and tribe, Americanized
not by any tradition or other educational
process than that of having the
typical American experiences in what still
remains the heart of the country.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh has never been a place to
emigrate from. It has held its own, and
constantly invites each nationality to
bring more of its kind. The only deserters
were those who found it in them
to care for a reasonable measure of cultivated
life, difficult to secure in a town
where there was not a library worthy
of the name until 1895 and where a
whole winter would sometimes pass without
a single lecture on a significant
theme intelligently treated. It was natural
that in the formative period there
were some who sought more congenial
associations in the seacoast cities.</p>

<p>In religion until comparatively recent
days it could be said that there was not
a more Calvinistic atmosphere about
Edinburgh, Glasgow or Belfast. The
early Pittsburghers had almost as
strong a tradition of what it means to
fight for their faith as the Puritans
themselves, and this sense has not had
time yet altogether to fade. The orthodox
spirit of the town has all along palpably
affected the religion of the other
racial types. So it is hardly surprising
to find that certain regulations of the
Catholic Church seem to be more insistently
promulgated and more rigorously
observed in Pittsburgh than in
other places.</p>

<p>There is not a city in the country, and
probably not in the world, where strict
Sabbath and liquor legislation is more
strenuously put into effect. Unusually
genial people to those who do well, they
are summary and even relentless with
those who would lower the moral decorum
of the city. But as is very likely
to happen where there is a rigid ethical
creed, there is here a very anomalous
double standard. The amount of Sunday
work in the steel mills is appalling.
There is a certain sanctity in the operations
of business which enables it in
specific ways to nullify the precepts of
religion, as when the over-strain of seven
days' work a week is measured in the
gradual destruction of the religious sense
in great sections of the population. Local
option sentiment is easily bewildered
by political cross-currents. Though
the Brooks law maintains a severe standard
as to the conduct of the saloon business,
applied by the county judges to
whom a complaint is <i>prima facie</i> adverse
evidence; yet Pennsylvania remains, in
the midst of an unexampled national
temperance movement, among the small
and ignoble company of states marked
black on the reformers' map.</p>

<p>Few cities have had a greater degree
of political machine control, and the
prime sources of this corruption have
been nowhere else than among the
Scotch-Irish. Ever since the days of
Simon Cameron a clan-like political organization
has dominated the state of
Pennsylvania; and the city of Pittsburgh
has been only a less important headquarters
for its operations than Philadelphia.
The condition of politics in Pennsylvania
has led many to think that the
people of the state were characterized
by a generally lax moral sense. On the
contrary, and in Pittsburgh particularly,
this situation is because of a too intense
and therefore too restricted ethical motive.
The passage and enforcement of
certain types of legislation having an immediate
and obvious ethical bearing satisfies
this restricted ethical demand, and
sidetracks tendencies which might check
the indirect causes of great underlying
demoralization. A long list of charities
each year receives substantial appropriations
from the Legislature. The 20,000
earnest and influential people in Pennsylvania
who are members of managing
boards of philanthropic institutions receiving
state subsidies, are by the same
token so much less inclined and less able
to be alert and watchful against such
matters as the theft of millions from the
state treasury and from banks which
carry state accounts.</p>

<p>The difficulty with Pennsylvania, and
emphatically with Pittsburgh, is not degeneracy;
it is simply public moral
adolescence, and the confusion that inevitably
accompanies it. The materialism
of Pittsburgh is that of the overwrought,
not of the over-indulgent. No
one can study the life of the city
without feeling a mighty under-current
of moral capacity not yet in any sufficient
degree brought to the surface.
Its religion cultivates definite restraints
and reassurances, rather than aspiration
and moral enterprise. This is,
however, always the case when a community's
moral powers are absorbed in
the subduing of nature and the achieving
of a great material destiny. The
spirit of adventure in Pittsburgh has
been thus far economic. The moral
movement of this people in any case
is slow: but it is unyielding always; and
once fully aroused knows how to be irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation can hardly seem abnormal
when one realizes the unsurpassed
material resources of the Pittsburgh district
and the pressure which has been
laid upon a single community by the
whole world for the products out of
which the foundations of world enlightenment
are laid. It is of particular importance
in the case of Pittsburgh, that
the social student should take the full
measure of the function of the city as the
almost limitless and tireless creator of
the solid means of civilized existence, for
this and other nations. The simple fact
that it is the first city in the country in
the tonnage of its product, and the second
city of the country in banking capital,
largely on account of its great wage
payments, will suggest both the service
which it renders and the power which it
has achieved. It is significant that in
this district the two greatest individual
fortunes in history have been amassed
and the two most gigantic concentrations
of economic power built up.</p>

<p>Without in the least abating the test
of moral and legal standards upon the
policy of industrial leadership in the
great activities of western Pennsylvania,
it can hardly be doubted that later generations
will include the leaders in such enterprise
among the master builders of
modern civilization. The place of Pittsburgh
in the American system of life is
that of the city which in an altogether unparalleled
way is made up of producers,
of those whose purposes are focused in
bringing to pass the creation of durable
and indispensable utilities. Contrasted
with Pittsburgh, every other city in the
country is rather a market-place, made
more refined but in some sense less noble
by the dominance of traders and consumers.</p>

<p>It is one of the curious anomalies of
American legislation that it should have
so zealously guarded against foreign
competition in price standards, while
withholding all protection against competitors
bringing with them a low wage
standard. Pittsburgh, in its larger estate,
may be said to be a monument to this
anomaly. Severe restrictive protection
against foreign steel, and unlimited immigration,
have enabled Pittsburgh, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>well-enough
otherwise provided, to throw the
reins upon the neck of her prosperity.
And it must be borne in mind that the
protective system, for years tacitly
acknowledged by Pittsburgh manufacturers
to be unnecessary, is yet clung to as
an exclusive and powerful tribal fetich,
from whose point of view every question
as to the welfare of the nation must first
be considered. The fresh constructive
moral aspects of politics and patriotism
impress Pittsburgh probably less easily
than any other community in the country.</p>

<p>So great and continuous has been the
tide of immigration, that the insistence
of the new immigrants for employment
on any terms has made it comparatively
easy for industrial captains to control
industrial administration, to the exclusion
of all substantial efforts on the part of
the workmen to organize in their own behalf.
Beginning with the British operatives
and coming down through the successive
types to the present southeast
Europeans, each type up to the present
has gradually raised its demands, made
some headway, organized to reach still
higher ground, lost by attack from both
front and rear, and disappeared up and
down the social scale in the general community.
This very costly process has
been thought necessary to industrial prosperity.
There is, of course, no doubt
that the holding down of the wage standard,
like the artificial maintenance of the
price standard, has conduced largely to
the making of some of the great personal
fortunes; but it is certain that the future
historian will find this checking of the
normal and typically American aspirations
of successive waves of newcomers,
to have been distinctly detrimental to the
economic, quite as well as to the social
and political well-being of the Pittsburgh
community. This unthrift in the matter
of the prime essential productive force
and economic value is again partly accounted
for by the very pressure of opportunity
afforded by unlimited resources
and the insatiable demand of the world
market. There has not even been sufficient
time for consideration of many
economies in process and administration
whose value to manufactures would be
unquestioned.</p>

<p>It is to the point here to remember
that the two great fortunes just mentioned
began to be great as individual fortunes
through special privileges gained
in railroad rates. The topographical
convergence of the Great Lake region
on the one side and the Ohio river valley
on the other to a territory less than a
hundred miles wide, brought all the chief
means of transportation between the
West and the Atlantic seaboard through
this particular territory. These exceptional
facilities for transportation gave a
culminating stimulus to industrial progress.</p>

<p>The intense localization of resources
and transportation facilities led almost
inevitably to the phenomenal concentration
of industrial capital, followed by
highly centralized industrial administration.
This process has in a sense been
its own undoing, so far as Pittsburgh is
concerned, because the financial and even
the administrative center of the great
combinations have inevitably gravitated
to New York, and the old type of self-reliant
leader of industry is fast disappearing.
Yet the lesson of the large
spirit of associated production is constantly
being inwrought into the consciousness
of the community. A later
article in this series will show that the
statesmanlike initiative, which until recent
days had been inevitably swung into the
strategy of business, is beginning to express
itself in many promising forms of
public spirited activity.</p>

<p>Physical environment, no less than
racial stock and economic factors, condition
the development of public sentiment
in a community. The growth of Pittsburgh
as a center of population under
the pressure of business opportunity
would have been very greatly hampered
if electric transit had not prepared the
way. The ground plan runs up and
down almost impossible foldings of hill
and valley. The electric cars make possible
the utilizing of all the slopes and
hilltops for homes. This has weakened
the inevitable centripetal force of urban
growth, and led to the building up of suburbs
very accessible to the central business
section, and comparing for attractiveness
and comfort with those of any
other city in the country. Such a transfer
of well-to-do population has made
possible other important shiftings both
of poorer population and of business, by
which the business center has gained in
area and in the character and adaptability
of its structures.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh has grown into an industrial
metropolis with outlying manufacturing
towns reaching along the rivers,
and following the course of all the railroads
for a distance of thirty or forty
miles. The time is soon coming when
all the large industries will be eliminated
from the city, and Pittsburgh proper will
become simply the commercial and cultural
headquarters of its district.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all these methods of expansion
and relief have not been sufficient
to give adequate room in the downtown
section either for industry, trade or
housing. This area, which is closely
hemmed in by the rivers and the hills,
now includes the great central commercial
activities, the railroad terminals, several
large industrial plants and numerous
smaller ones, together with the homes of
the unskilled population which finds employment
within it.</p>

<p>The congestion within these tight limits
brings out, in a peculiarly acute way, the
breakdown of many branches of the social
administration of the city, from the point
of view of the welfare of its population
as a whole. Here not only the unfitness
of hundreds of houses under existing conditions
for human habitation, but the
actual and serious shortage of roofs under
which to shelter the lower grades of
the industrial population, is most strikingly
seen. Here typhoid fever, for
which Pittsburgh has these many years
held a tragic pre-eminence, is at its highest
rate. Here the actual congestion of
machinery within industrial plants which
cannot get land to expand upon, is particularly
conducive to the diseases, and
to accidents which are associated with the
different branches of industry.</p>

<p>In this situation appears another of
the strange contrasts of Pittsburgh life.
The problem of the downtown district is
further complicated by the fact that great
sections of it are held under a landlord
system like that of the old world. Thirty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
million dollars' worth of real estate
located almost wholly in the downtown
district is held by five estates, some of
the holders living abroad permanently,
others traveling much of the time. Commercial
enterprise is handicapped by the
difficulty of securing an independent title
to real estate. Much of the most objectionable
tenement house property is held
by two of these estates. Absentee landlordism
thus oddly parallels absentee capitalism.
To the fact that the industrial
authorities are remote and, by controlling
many plants, can take the fiscal rather
than the close range administrative view
of industry, must be largely traced that
stern reprobation of any equity on the
part of the workman in his work, which
has on occasion made, and will again
make Pittsburgh the country's chief point
of social unrest and danger.</p>

<p>The anti-trade-union policy tends
strongly to fix and standardize the immigrant
rate of wages, and has given
strong cumulative force to the personal
profit-reapings of the past two decades.
Recognizing clearly the serious limitations
of trade unionism as part of the
organization of a tumultuous industry
like that of Pittsburgh, it must still be
said that there is substantial evidence to
believe that the community cheats itself
when it keeps up a glutted labor market
and a lower than standard wage. However
this may be, the Pittsburgh employers'
point of view, more than that of any
other city of the country, is like that of
England in the early days of the factory
system,&mdash;holding employes guilty of a
sort of impiety, and acting with sudden
and sure execution, if they undertake to
enforce their claims in such way as to
embarrass the momentum of great business
administration. A sound standard
of living for the workman and his right
by organized competition to win it, Pittsburgh
must eventually recognize as fundamental
to the country's economic and
political welfare. Should she persist in
excluding trade unionism, European experience
shows that her hordes of immigrants
will quickly learn to carry their
alien types of unrest to the ballot box.</p>

<p>The backwardness of Pittsburgh in the
development of culture and public spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
must be traced in part to the negative
attitude of a serious minded people toward
the amenities of life, and their distrust
of the process of government.
There has been no sufficient tradition in
the city of more balanced and varied human
interests. The city's population, instead
of finding an increasing social
unity, has been increasingly sectionalized
by the overwhelming influx of every type
of immigrant. There has not been leisure
for the consideration and discussion of
public questions. The very ground plan
of the city, which scatters all of its responsible
citizens through the suburbs
at night, tends to deprive the city of their
disinterested co-operation out of office
hours toward raising its tone and standards.
But other American cities have
shown how, when many of their people
began to be released from the treadmill
of the purely industrial stage of their
growth, it is possible to take advantage
of the experience of older communities
and move by long strides toward a humanized
type of urban life.</p>

<p>From the foremost absentee capitalist
and the foremost absentee landlord have
come as gifts the two epoch-making improvements
toward the finer public life
of the city. Schenley Park and the Carnegie
institutions located at its entrance
form a civic center whose possibilities
of civic influence are very great. It may
be noted that the coming in of these improvements
was coincident with the work
of a city engineer who, indifferent to the
political principles under which the city
was administered, and acting as a kind of
despot within his domain, carried through
many great improvements in the layout
of the new districts of the city, and with
the first move in the direction of a great
hospital, which is one day to be built with
money left for the purpose by the man
who for many years was the political
master of the city.</p>

<p>The effect upon the city of benefits
wrought out in this undemocratic fashion
will of course be subject to heavy abatements;
but it would be a strange doctrinaire
who could not see that these specific
steps represent most substantial net gains
in the life of the community. There is
indeed a distinct undertone of feeling
that such benefactions represent simply
a return to the city of what the city itself
has produced. One can find comparatively
few indications that the park, the
library and the rest have placed the city
under the depressing bonds of patronage.
The existence and service of these institutions,
in any case, give a new and
strong focus to the rising city sense, and
the evidence goes to show that, rather
than weakening the spirit of collective
initiative on the part of the citizens
themselves, they have conduced to give
shape and force to it.</p>

<p>There are several instructive ways in
which this growth of civic consciousness
is expressing itself. The movement for
a greater Pittsburgh now consummated
in the union of Pittsburgh and Allegheny
with a few adjacent towns, arises no
doubt in the general effort toward power
and prestige; but the step toward inclusiveness
is entirely normal, and has gathered
up into a public movement aggressive
impulses which had never before run
in that channel. Happily the expansion
was preceded by the election for the first
time in a generation of a reform mayor.
The movement came directly as a result
of the impudent interference of the state
machine in unseating a mayor who had
been elected by an opposing local faction.
This action, carried out under the forms
of legislation, brought Pittsburgh people
into a new feeling of municipal self-respect,
and led to their electing on a
democratic ticket George W. Guthrie,
who is in every respect one of Pittsburgh's
first citizens and has for many
years been earnestly interested in the
cause of municipal reform.</p>

<p>The date 1898 may be taken as marking
a kaleidoscopic shifting in the Pittsburgh
ensemble. Then the city emerged
into the day of large things,&mdash;into the
great concentration of capital, and the
incidental liquidation which gave many
families overpowering fortunes of cash
in hand; the assembling of vast heterogeneous
multitudes of laborers to keep
up with the demands of a period of unparalleled
prosperity; the ampler civic
sense signalized by the Carnegie institutions
with their unusual cultural opportunities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
and embodied after a time in
solid municipal reform and progress, in
a truly enlightened Chamber of Commerce,
and in excellent forms of social
service. On the one hand, irresponsible
individuals have gone forth with boundless
power to represent the city to the
world at her worst. On the other,
Pittsburgh is gradually and quietly taking
to herself the world's lessons in the
making of the modern city and in the
building up of citizenship. The former
phenomenon, in which to many this city
is allegorized, is but the froth and the
scum; the latter has the beginnings of a
tidal energy behind it.</p>

<p>The day laborer of a generation ago is
gone,&mdash;a change which has been swifter
and more complete in Pittsburgh than
in many other of our industrial centers.
"Where are your Irish? your Welsh?
your Germans? your Americans?" I asked
an old mill hand. "Go to the city hall
and the police station," he said. "Some
of them are still in the better paid jobs in
the mills; but mostly you'll have to look
for them among the doctors and lawyers
and office holders; among clerks and accountants
and salesmen. You'll find
them there."</p>

<p>The day laborer in the mills to-day is
a Slav. The foreign-born of the steel
district comprise, it is true, every European
nation, but I shall deal here only
with the races from southeastern
Europe, which for twenty years have
been steadily displacing the Teutonic and
Keltic peoples in the rough work of the
industries. The tendency of the Italians
is to go into construction and railroad
work, a few entering the mines, rather
than into the plants and yards; and my
group narrows itself down to the dominant
Slav and Lithuanian. What I have
to say of them in Pittsburgh and Allegheny
City is in the main representative
of the manufacturing towns of the whole
district.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, one-quarter of the
population of Pittsburgh is foreign-born.
The foreigner is nowhere more at home
than here, and nowhere has he been more
actively welcomed by employers. The
conflict of customs and habits, varying
standards of living, prejudices, antipathies,
all due to the confluence of representatives
of different races of men, may
be witnessed here. The most backward
of these foreigners are superstitious and
ignorant and are the victims of cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
knaves and unscrupulous parasites. On
the other hand, the whole territory is
thrown into a stern struggle for subsistence
and wage-standards by the displacements
due to these resistless accretions
to the ranks of the workers. The moral
and religious life of the city is not less
affected by this inflow of peoples. Their
religious training differs widely from
that of peoples of Protestant antecedents,
and institutions that were dear to the
founders of the city are fast undermined
by the customs of immigrants from
southeastern Europe. Yet as a whole,
they bring with them physical and cultural
resources which the English-speaking
community fails to elicit or thoughtlessly
wastes.</p>

<p>Such an exhaustive study as could be
made of the immigrant population of
the steel district is outside the possibilities
of this paper. I shall set down only
what a month brought me as I visited
the lodging-houses and the courts and
the mills of Greater Pittsburgh; as I
talked with priest and leader, policeman
and doctor, banker and labor boss, the
immigrants themselves and those who
live close to them; but I shall put it before
you in the light of many years' residence
in the anthracite coal communities,
where in another section of Pennsylvania,
at Mahanoy City and Wilkes-Barre
and Scranton, I have known the
Slav and the Lett and their efforts to gain
a foothold in America. I shall deal with
the situation, not as I have seen it in
my visits of the past year, during which
the immigrants have returned home by
thousands, but as I came to know it in
the heyday of prosperity, the early fall
of 1907, when conditions were as they
are likely to be again when industrial
prosperity returns. This is the situation
which we must reckon with in a permanent
way.</p>

<p>In 1880, Slavs, Lithuanians and Italians
did not form one per cent of the
population in either Pittsburgh or Allegheny.
By 1890, they had reached four
per cent, and out of an army of 90,000
wage earners, one in every ten was an
immigrant from southeastern Europe.
By 1900, one-third of the foreign-born
were of this new immigration, and the
movement of the Teutonic and Keltic
races had practically ceased. We must
wait until the census enumeration of
1910 before we may definitely know what
proportion these newcomers form to-day,
but it may safely be assumed that
the percentage of foreign-born in the
greater city will equal that of 1900, thirty
per cent, or roughly, 200,000, half of
whom will be from southeastern Europe.</p>

<p>Poles, Italians and Jewish immigrants
lead the list. Lithuanians, Croatians,
Servians, Slovaks and Ruthenians are
numbered by the thousands, and Magyars,
Greeks, Bohemians and Roumanians
are here in lesser groups.</p>

<p>The representatives of these nations
touch elbows in the streets so that the
languages heard when the people are
marketing in the foreign quarters on Saturday
night are as numerous as those
of a seaport town. Twenty dialects are
spoken. Yet the polyglot mass that confuses
the visitor and induces pessimistic
impressions as to the future of the city,
is each morning marshalled without tumult.
The discipline of the industrial
establishments converts this babel of
tongues into one of the chief forces of
production. Therein lies an appraisal not
only of the American <i>entrepreneur</i>, but
also of these men coming from nations
of low efficiency, who are able so quickly
to fall into line and keep step in an industrial
army of remarkable discipline
and output.</p>

<p>There is no way of knowing the annual
inflow of immigrants into Pittsburgh,
for the city is a distributing point.
The records of the ports of entry show
that in 1907, 187,618 persons gave Pittsburgh
as their destination, but many
of these scattered to the neighboring
Pennsylvania towns and many undoubtedly
went to the mills and mines of
Eastern Ohio. Every day brings its
quota of immigrants in normal times;
occasionally they come by the carloads.
Owing to the shifting of the newcomers,
however, the outflow may often equal the
inflow. Conditions of the local industries
determine which of these two currents
runs the swifter. During the first seven
years of the century, the city possibly
added 15,000 annually by immigration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span></p>

<p>Before taking up the living conditions
in Pittsburgh as they especially affect
these immigrant laborers, let us consider
for a moment certain characteristics of
these people, and their relation to the
general economic situation. First, it is
the wages that bring them here. The
workers in the mills of Galicia, the vine-lands
of Italy, and the factories of Kiev,
earn from twenty-five cents to fifty cents
in a day of from twelve to sixteen hours.
When the American immigrant writes
home that he works only nine, ten, or
twelve hours and earns from $1.50 to
$2.00, the able-bodied
wage earner
in the fatherland
who hears
this will not be
satisfied until he
also stands where
the shorter day
and the higher
wages govern. It
is these home-going
letters more
than all else which
recruit the labor
force. They are
efficient promoters
of immigration.
"There are no
able-bodied men,"
said Big Sam to
me, "between the
ages of sixteen
and fifty years left
in my native town
in Servia; they
have all come to
America."</p>

</div>

<p>Up to September, 1907, the men in
charge of furnaces, foundries, forges
and mills, in the Pittsburgh district,
could not get the help they needed.
The cry everywhere was, "Give us
men." A foreman, therefore, could
assure Pietro and Melukas that if
their brothers or cousins, or friends were
sent for, they would get work as soon as
they arrived. More than that, the Slav
and Italian are no longer dependent on
the English boss in the matter of finding
work for their countrymen. The inflow
of immigration from southeastern
Europe has assumed such proportions in
the industries of the cities that superintendents
have, in some instances, appointed
Italian and Polish and Lithuanian
foremen; and with these, as with
German and Irish, blood is thicker than
water. They employ their fellow countrymen.
They know the condition of
the labor market and can by suggestion
stimulate or retard immigration.</p>

<p>The tonnage industries of Pittsburgh
have expanded tremendously in the last
two decades. Such industries need manual
laborers as do no others. The Slavs
have brawn for
sale. Herein, at
bottom, is the
drawing force
which accounts for
such a moving in
of peoples and the
readiness with
which they find
their places in the
specialized industries
of the district.
Pittsburgh
has clamorous
need for these
men. Take the average
Lithuanian,
Croatian, Ruthenian,
or Slovak, and
his physique
would compare favorably
with that
of any people.
Most of the immigrants
are from
agricultural communities.
Their
food in the fatherland was coarse,
their habits simple, their cares few.
They had an abundance of vegetable
diet, pure water, pure air and
sunshine, and they developed strong physical
organisms. Taking them as a
whole, we get the best of the agricultural
communities. The day has not yet
come when the weak emigrate and the
strong stay at home. No ship agents,
however active, can reverse the natural
order of the tide of immigration, and
natural selection added to federal scrutiny
gives us a body of men physically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
most fit for the development of our industries.
Nowhere has this been better
illustrated than in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>These men come to be "the hewers of
wood and carriers of water." There
are representatives of each race far removed
from the lowest industrial
stratum, but taking these people as a
whole, it is safe to say that the bulk of
the unskilled labor in the city,&mdash;the digging
and carrying in the streets, the
heavy labor in the mill, the loading and
unloading of raw material on railroad
and river, the rough work around forge
and foundry, the coarse work around factories,
and the lifting necessary in machine
shops,&mdash;all is performed by them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/fig042.jpg" width="660" height="513" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>YOUNG SLOVAK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This is the level at which they enter
the economic order. What trade equipment
do they bring into the work with
them? Their industrial efficiency is low
and I should estimate that ninety-five
per cent have no knowledge of modern
machinery or methods of modern production;
they are children in factory
training. Further, those who have trades
find themselves in an industrial environment
where their previous training is of
little value. They are in ignorance of
the English language, and the few mechanics
and tradesmen among them can
do no better than join the ranks of the
common laborers. We must bear in
mind, however, that those of them who
know how to use tools, once they are put
to work that requires some skill, adapt
themselves quickly to the situation.
Hence we meet not a few Slavs and
Lithuanians who execute work of a semi-skilled
nature. Sons, also, of men of
these nationalities who settled in the city
a generation ago have risen to positions
of standing in the industries. Thus it is
not unusual to hear of this man or that
who has become a foreman in the mills
or taken a place in business or in the
professions.</p>

<p>But on several counts the average
Slav, Lithuanian and Italian are not as
acceptable as day laborers as were the
immigrants from northwestern Europe.
The common opinion of American employers
is that they are stupid and that
the supervisory force must be much larger
than if they had English speaking
help. Many employers would no doubt,
prefer the latter; but they cannot get
them for the wages offered; they must
take the Slav or run short handed. The
United States commissioner of immigration
in Pittsburgh is constantly besieged
by employers of labor who need help.
Many stories are told of one firm stealing
a group of laborers marshalled at
the ports of entry and forwarded to another.</p>

</div>

<p>I have spoken of the influence which
letters and money sent home have in recruiting
immigrant workmen. These
people make little or no use of labor
agencies unless the saloon and the small
bank may be so denominated. There are
men in each nationality, acknowledged
leaders, who play the part of intermediaries
between superintendents and their
people. But such investigations as I
have made at Ellis Island do not lead
me to believe that the employers of labor
in Pittsburgh violate the contract labor
law. Labor agencies in New York city
make a specialty of distributing Slavs,
Lithuanians and Italians to firms in need
of hands. The leader who supplies men
to a mill or mining concern gets so much
for each man supplied. Whatever contract
there may be is executed this side
of the water. For instance, a leading
Croatian had a specific understanding
with one of the mills of Pittsburgh that
all men he brings will find employment.
No contract was executed and in the
opinion of the local immigration agent,
there was in it no violation of the contract
labor law.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>YOUNG CROATIAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have noted the drawbacks to the new
day laborer as such. On the other hand,
it is a common opinion in the district
that some employers of labor give the
Slavs and Italians preference because of
their docility, their habit of silent submission,
their amenability to discipline,
and their willingness to work long hours
and over time without a murmur. Foreigners
as a rule earn the lowest wages
and work the full stint of hours. I found
them in the machine shops working sixty
hours a week; at the blast furnaces working
twelve hours a day for seven days in
the week. The common laborer in and
around the mills works seventy-two hours
a week. The unit of wages is an hour rate
for day labor and a Slav is willing to take
the longer hours (twelve hours a day for
men who work fourteen and sixteen in
the fatherland) with extra work on Sundays,
especially in connection with clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
the yards and repairing. Possibly
sixty to seventy per cent of the laborers
in the mills come out Sundays and the
mechanics and other laborers on occasions
work thirty-six hours in order that
the plant may start on time. In one mill
I found Russians (Greek Orthodox) in
favor for the reason that they gladly
worked on Sundays.</p>

<img src="images/fig043b.jpg" width="662" height="522" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>YOUNG SERVIAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>My belief is that certain employers of
labor have reaped advantage from racial
antipathies. The Pole and the Lithuanian
have nothing in common and each
of them despises the Slovak. Foremen
know this and use their knowledge when
foreigners are likely to reach a common
understanding upon wages or conditions
of labor. All these considerations have
helped make it less difficult for factory
operators to keep open or non-union shop
in Pittsburgh. The constant influx of
raw material from backward nations into
the industries of the city has had somewhat
the same effect as the flow of water
at an estuary when the tide is rising. All
is commotion. It will continue to be so
as long as the inflow of Slavs and Italians
continues as it has in the last decade. But
when they have become permanently
placed and their average intelligence and
grasp of American conditions rise, racial
prejudices will give way to common
interests. When this time comes, Pittsburgh
will witness the rise of stronger
labor organizations than were ever effected
by Teuton and Kelt.</p>

<p>We have seen, then, the Slavic day laborers
coming into the steel district in
vast numbers. Of their strength and lack
of skill at the outset there is no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
and we have noted some of the snap judgments
that are current about them; such
as, that they are stupid, and submissive.
All this puts us in better position to consider
more in detail my first statement
that it is the wages that bring them to
Pittsburgh, and to see what advances they
make once they have gained a foothold.
The Slav enters the field at a rate of pay
for day labor which is higher than that
which brought the Germans and the
Kelts. The lowest wage I found Slavs
working for was thirteen and one-half
cents an hour. The wage of common
labor in the average mill is fifteen or sixteen
and a half cents. The day laborer
around the furnaces gets from $1.65 to
$1.98 a day.</p>

<p>But the newcomers know nothing of a
standard wage, and when work is scarce,
they will offer to work for less than is
paid for common labor. Such was the
case of a band of Croatians who offered
their services to a firm in Pittsburgh for
$1.20 a day. When the superintendent
heard it, he said, "My God, what is the
country coming to? How can a man live
in Pittsburgh on $1.20 a day?" The foreman
replied, "Give them rye bread, a
herring, and beer, and they are all right."
[I have known a coal operator in the
anthracite fields to pay Italians and Slovaks
ninety cents a day, and ask neither
what was the country coming to nor how
they could subsist.] More, the Slavs
will consciously cut wages in order to
get work. A man who knows something
about blacksmithing or carpentering will
work at a trade for $1.65 or $1.75 when
the standard wage may be $2.50. They
count their money in the denominations
of the fatherland and estimate its value
according to old country standards. I
have known foremen to take advantage
of this. Again, those who are skilled will
at the command of the boss render menial
services without a murmur. "These fellows
have no pride," said an American
craftsman to me, "they are not ruled by
custom. When the foreman demands it
they will throw down the saw or hammer
and take the wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>So the Slav gains his foothold in the
Pittsburgh industries, and in the doing
of it, he undermines the income of the
next higher industrial groups and gains
the enmity of the Americans. Shrewd
superintendents are known not only to
take advantage of the influx of unskilled
labor to keep down day wages, but to
reduce the pay of skilled men by a gradually
enforced system of promoting the
Slavs. In the place of six men at ten
dollars a day, one will be employed at
fifteen dollars, with five others at half, or
less than half, the old rate, who will work
under the high-priced man. Inventions,
changes in processes, new machines, a
hundred elements tend to complicate the
situation and render it difficult to disentangle
the influence of any one element.
But this much is clear, the new immigration
is a factor which is influencing the
economic status of the whole wage-earning
population in Pittsburgh; it is bound
to be a permanent factor; and its influence
will be more and not less.</p>

<p>My estimate is that possibly twenty
per cent of these laborers from southeastern
Europe now work at machines
which require a week or two weeks to
acquire the skill needed in their operation.
To be sure, they are machines "so simple
that a child could operate them, and so
strong that a fool cannot break them."
Many Slovaks work in the Pressed Steel
Car Company in Allegheny, as riveters,
punchers, and pressmen, while others are
fitters, carpenters, and blacksmiths.
Some Croatians and Servians are rising
and are found in the steel mills as roughers
and catchers. I saw Ruthenians feeding
machines with white heated bars of
steel. It was simple, mechanical work,
but of a higher grade than that of scrap-carrier.
The Poles who in recent years
emigrated from Russia and Austria-Hungary
are as industrially efficient as
any group of immigrants and work in
both mills and foundries. A foreigner
who has a chance to become a machine
operator generally goes into piece work
and earns from $2 to $2.50 a day. But
all men at the machines are not on piece
work. A foreman explained this to me
as follows: "If the machine depends
upon the man for speed, we put him on
piece work; if the machine drives the
man, we pay him by the day." The man
operating a machine by the day gets from
$1.75 to $2. Many boys and young women
of Slavic parentage work in the spike,
nut and bolt, and steel wire factories.
They sit before machines and pickling
urns for ten hours for from seventy-five
cents to $1 a day. The Slovak riveters,
punchers, shears-men and pressmen in the
Pressed Steel Car Company's plant are
paid by the piece, and for the most part
make from $35 to $50 in two weeks. Fitters,
carpenters, blacksmiths and painters
are getting from $2 to $2.50 by the
day. Mr. Bozic, the banker, told me of
Croatians and Servians who made as
high as $70 in two weeks, and others who
made between $3 and $4 a day&mdash;many of
them in positions which once paid English-speaking
workmen twice those sums.
High and low are relative terms and they
signify very different standards to a
Slav and to an American. But it is a
mistake to imagine that the Slav or
Lithuanian cannot adapt himself to modern
industrial conditions. There is considerable
of prophecy in the thousands of
them already doing efficient work in the
mills. The sooner the English-speaking
workers recognize this and make friends
of these workers, the better. No class of
work is now monopolized by Teutons and
Kelts, and the service rendered by the
Slav and Lithuanian will before many
years equal theirs in market value.</p>

<p>With this rapid statement of the economic
position of the Slavs, we can
more intelligently approach the problem
of their living conditions. But first let
us bear sharply in mind that their work
is often cast among dangers; is often inimical
to health.</p>

<p>Many work in intense heat, the din of
machinery and the noise of escaping
steam. The congested condition of most
of the plants in Pittsburgh adds to the
physical discomforts for an out-of-doors
people; while their ignorance of the language
and of modern machinery increases
the risk. How many of the Slavs,
Lithuanians and Italians are injured in
Pittsburgh in one year is not known. No
reliable statistics are compiled. In their
absence people guess, and the mischief
wrought by contradictory and biased
statements is met on all hands. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
mentioned a plant that had a bad reputation
to a priest, he said, "Oh, that is the
slaughter-house; they kill them there
every day." I quote him not for his accuracy,
but to show how the rumors circulate
and are real to the people themselves.
It is undoubtedly true, that
exaggerated though the reports may be,
the waste in life and limb is great, and
if it all fell upon the native born a cry
would long since have gone up which
would have stayed the slaughter.</p>

<p>In the matter of compensation for injuries,
the foreign-speaking are often
subjected to hardships and injustice. If
the widow of a man killed in a mine or
mill of Pennsylvania lives in Europe,
she cannot recover any damages, although
the accident may be entirely due
to the neglect of the company. Because
of this ruling, certain strong companies
in the Pittsburgh district seldom pay a
cent to the relatives of the deceased if
they dwell beyond the seas. I asked a
leader among the Italians, "Why do you
settle the serious cases for a few hundred
dollars?" He replied: "We find it best
after much bitter experience. The courts
are against us; a jury will not mulct a
corporation to send money to Europe;
the relatives are not here to bewail their
loss in court; the average American cares
nothing for the foreigner. Every step of
the way we meet with prejudices and find
positive contempt, from those in highest
authority in the courts down to the tip-staff.
When I settle for $200, I can do
nothing better."</p>

<p>The influence of the industries reaches
still further into the lives of the immigrants.
Each people has a tendency to
colonize in one section of the city and
work in some one mill. The Bohemians
are strong in Allegheny City, but few
of them are found in Pittsburgh. The
Slovaks predominate in McKees Rocks
and Allegheny City, and many of them
are found in the Soho district of Pittsburgh.
The Poles are numerous in many
parts of the greater city. The Lithuanians
live in large numbers on the South
Side, and near the National Tube Works
and the American Steel and Wire Company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
Many Ruthenians work in the
Oliver Steel Works, while the Croatians
and Servians have worked for the most
part in the Jones and Laughlin plants.
My information is that foremen try to
get one nationality in assigning work to
a group of laborers, for they know that
a homogeneous group will give best results.
National pride also enters into
selection. In talking to a Lithuanian of
the serious loss of life which occurred
when a furnace blew up, I asked, "Were
any of your people killed in that accident?"
He answered quickly, "No; catch
our people do such work as that! There
you find the Slovak." Of the grades of
unskilled labor, the Slovak, Croatian,
Servian and Russian (Greek Orthodox)
may be said to perform the roughest and
most risky, and the most injurious to
health. There is, then, a more or less
natural selection of peoples in the neighborhoods
of the different great mills.</p>

<p>The geographical contour of the region
has also had its influence in keeping
the foreign population within certain
limited districts. The two rivers, the
Allegheny and the Monongahela, have
cut their beds in the Allegheny range,
leaving a narrow strip of land on either
side of their banks which offers limited
sites for dwellings, mills and factories.
The lowlands were preempted long ago,
and the contest for parts of them between
the mills and the homes has been
intense. There is an advantage to the
employer, however, in having his crude
labor force within easy call, and night
work and the cost of carfare help keep
the mass of men employed in common
labor near the mills and on the congested
lowlands. The deplorable conditions I
found among them I shall describe, but
let me say here that all the houses on the
flats are not the same. I visited homes
of Slavs and Lithuanians which were
clean, well furnished, and equal in comfort
to those of Americans of the same
economic level. These foreigners have
been in the country many years and their
children have risen to the American
standard. But our first concern is with
the recent comers, who too often live
in lodgings that are filthy; whose peasant
habits seem to us uncouth; and
whose practices are fatal to decency and
morality in a thickly settled district.</p>

<p>Yet the foreigner pays a higher rent
than does the "white man." In Bass
street, Allegheny City, I found English-speaking
tenants paying fifteen dollars
a month for four rooms, where Slavs
were charged twenty dollars. Landlords
who received ten dollars and twelve
dollars a month for houses rented to
the English-speaking, were getting seventeen
and eighteen dollars from the
Slavs. On Penn avenue a Slav paid
seventeen dollars for three rooms, while
a family renting eight rooms in the front
of the building paid but thirty-three
dollars a month. As nearly as I could
estimate, the average monthly rent
paid by the foreigner in Pittsburgh is
more than four dollars a room. I
found one family paying nine dollars
and a half for one large room in an
old residence on the South Side; another
paid ten dollars for two rooms,
another sixteen dollars for three; and on
Brandt street I found a man who paid
twenty-two dollars a month for four.
The rent is not always fixed by the landlord.
Where lodgers are taken, it is
sometimes regulated by the number the
"boarding-boss" can crowd in, the landlord
getting one dollar a month extra
for each boarder. Houses of from eight
to twelve rooms have in them to-day
anywhere from three to six families.
They were built for one family, and until
the owners are forced by the Bureau of
Health to install sanitary appliances,
have equipment for but one. Too many
landlords when they rent to foreigners
have apparently one dominating passion,&mdash;rent.
They make no repairs, and with
the crowded condition above described
the houses soon bear marks of ill usage.
Whenever foreigners invade a neighborhood
occupied by English-speaking tenants,
property depreciates. The former
occupants get out, the invaders multiply,
and very often the properties pass into
the hands of speculators. Houses once
occupied by Slavs can seldom be rented
again to Anglo-Saxons. Foreigners
under stress for room use cellars as
bed rooms, and it is against these that
the health bureau within the last year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
has taken action. I saw one of these
beside which a common stable would
have been a parlor.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>NIGHT SCENE IN A SLAVIC LODGING HOUSE.</p>

<p>Three men in the far bed, two in the others, twelve in the room. In some of these lodgings day
workers sleep nights in beds occupied by night workers in the daytime.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But it is in the immigrant lodging
houses that conditions are worst. These
conditions are not always the choice of
the men. The Croatians, Servians, Roumanians
and Greeks have only from five
to ten per cent of women among them;
hence the men of these nationalities have
but few boarding houses conducted by
their own people to go to, and crowding
is inevitable. English-speaking and German
families will not open their doors to
them. Single men in groups of from six
to twenty go into one house in charge of
a boarding-boss and his wife. Each man
pays from seventy-five cents to a dollar
a week for room to sleep in and the little
cooking and washing that are to be done.
Food for the company is bought on one
book, and every two weeks the sum total
is divided equally among the boarders,
each man paying his <i>pro rata</i> share. The
bill for two weeks will hardly amount to
three dollars a man, so that the average
boarder will spend ten dollars a month
on room rent and maintenance. The
mania for saving results in many cases
in skimping the necessaries of life. A
priest told me of a Lithuanian who lived
on ten cents a day, and by helping the
landlady in her house work, the man
saved room rent. I found Russians
(Greek Orthodox) on Tustine street who
were paying three dollars a month for
room rent. They buy bread made by
Russian Jews, get a herring and a pot of
beer, and live,&mdash;not always,&mdash;in peace.
When they pay three dollars and fifty
cents for room rent, soup is included in
the contract. Domestic tragedies sometimes
invade these communal households,
such as a case of assault and battery
which came up in an alderman's office.
The complainant was a single man who
appeared with a ghastly scalp wound.
When this boarding-boss presented his
bill at the end of two weeks, the charges
were five dollars more than the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
thought they ought to be. He protested
and the boarding-boss took a hatchet to
silence him. The Italians are close livers;
but possibly the worst conditions I saw
were among the Armenians in the neighborhood
of Basin alley.</p>

<p>In these boarding establishments as a
general rule, the kitchen is commonly
used as a bedroom. When the boarding
boss rents two rooms, he and his wife
sleep in the kitchen, and the boarders
take the other room. It is not unusual
for a boarding-boss to rent but one room.
He and his wife put their bed in one
corner; the stove in another; and the
boarders take the remainder. Sometimes
the rooms are so crowded that the boss
and his wife sleep on the floor; and I
repeatedly found cases where beds were
being worked double shift,&mdash;night and
day. The city Bureau of Health has endeavored
to reduce the number of beds in
a room, but it does not follow that the
people occupying that room get out,&mdash;they
sleep on the floor minus the bed.
Here as elsewhere the problem is one
of the hardest for sanitary inspectors to
cope with.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SLAVIC LODGING HOUSE ON THE SOUTH SIDE.</p>

<p>Four beds; two in a bed. The young fellow at the table was writing home. Before him were
pictures of his mother and sisters in immaculate peasant costumes.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes four or six men rent a
house and run it themselves, doing their
own cooking and washing and occasionally
bringing in a woman to do a little
cleaning. They may stand this for about
six months and then get out when the
room is past the cleaning stage. Such
crowding is very prevalent in the low lying
parts of the South Side, in the neighborhood
of Penn avenue in the city
proper, and in sections of Allegheny.
Among the Russians of Tustine street I
found thirty-three persons living in one
house in six rooms and an attic. These
were distributed among three families.
The Croatians also are bad crowders. A
milk dealer told me of twenty-eight who
lived in a house in Carey alley. When
I asked, "How do they live?" his reply
was, "I don't know and don't care if I
get my money for my milk." In Pork
House row and near Eckert street in
Allegheny, things were no better, and
some blocks of houses under the California
avenue bridge were as bad as any
thing I saw.</p>

<p>Before we condemn immigrants for
the filth of their lodgings, we must remember
that they are largely rural peoples
unused to such city barracks. This
fact is illustrated especially in their ignorance
regarding that terror which has
waited upon foreigners in the Pittsburgh
district,&mdash;typhoid fever. Dr. Leon Sadowski
estimated that as high as fifty
per cent of all young foreigners who
come to Pittsburgh contract typhoid
fever within two years of their coming.
Dr. Maracovick told me that in four
years no less than 100 Croatians in the
neighborhood of Smallman street had
come down with the fever, and that most
of them died. "You cannot make the
foreigner believe that Pittsburgh water
is unwholesome," said Dr. Welsh of
Bellevue. "He comes from rural communities
where contamination of water is
unknown." Physicians told me of men
who had been warned, deliberately going
to the Allegheny to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>Where so many single men are huddled
together the laws of decency and
morality are hard to observe. The boarding
boss seldom has a family and, in going
the round of these houses, the absence
of children is conspicuous. A physician
among them told me, "The average
boarding-boss's wife cannot get any,&mdash;the
moral condition makes it a physical impossibility."
This stands in striking contrast
with the average Slavic woman who
in her natural environment, is the mother
of children. These mid-European peoples
are not so passionate as the Italians,
but many of the single men, as the case is
in all barracks life, fall into vice. A physician
told me that gonorrhea is very
prevalent among the Croatians and Servians.
Another physician said of the Slavs
in general, "They frequent cheap houses
and come out diseased and robbed."
Many bawdy houses are known in Pittsburgh
as "Johnny Houses," for the reason
that they are frequented by foreigners
whose proper names are unpronounceable
and who go by the name of "John."
The number entering these on a "wide-awake"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
(pay) Saturday night is large.
A man who knows this section fairly well,
said, "Sometimes these men have to wait
their turn." These are houses of the
cheapest kind given over to prostitutes
in the last stage.</p>

<p>The presence of young immigrant
women in the immigrant lodging houses
adds to the seriousness of the situation.
Here again it is a question of wages that
brings them to this country. They do the
drudgery in the hotels and restaurants
which English-speaking girls will not do;
and they are to be found in factories
working under conditions their English-speaking
sisters would resent. If any
persons need protection, these young
women do. There is no adequate inspection
of the labor employment agencies in
Pittsburgh which solicit patronage among
them, often to wrong them. Not only do
some of these agencies take their money
but they send girls to places unfit for
them. An innocent girl may learn the
character of the house only when it is too
late. And even in the boarding houses
their lot is a hard one, especially when
the men of the place are on a carouse.</p>

<p>The Slavs and Lithuanians are fond
of drink and spend their money freely on
it. Some spend more money on beer than
they do on food. The evidences of drink
in the homes are apparent on all sides;
and not only do national customs and
national tastes and usages make for
drunkenness, but the undeniable fact
that the liquor interests are the only
American institutions which effectively
reach the great mass of the non-English
speaking immigrants. Where
else does the stranger find opportunity
for recreation at his very hand?
Empty beer kegs and bottles are to be
seen everywhere among the houses of the
immigrant lodgers. In Latimore alley,
on a September morning, I counted twenty
empty kegs in the yard; and in another
corner there was a pile of empty bottles.
It is nothing unusual for a beer wagon
on Saturday to deliver into one of these
boarding houses from eight to twelve
cases of beer. When a keg is open the
boarders feel that they must drain it. "It
won't keep," they say. Sunday is the
day for drinking. One man often drinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
from fifteen to twenty bottles; while he
who drinks from the keg does away with
from two to three gallons. No social
gathering is complete without drink.
Marriages, baptisms, social occasions,
holidays are all celebrated with beer and
liquor. There is no good time and no
friendship without it. The Slavs usually
rent a hall to celebrate their weddings.
The scenes of debauchery with which
such festivities sometimes end are discountenanced
by the respectable element
among these people. Pool rooms afford
loafing places for the young men of
the worst sort. The cheap vaudeville
shows, nickelodeons, and skating rinks
are run for profit and not for the sake of
clean recreation such as the community
should in some way provide. But such
places cannot be eliminated unless the
craving of young people for amusement
is met intelligently and sanely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/fig050.jpg" width="468" height="672" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SLOVAK GIRL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Where the environment of the home is
unsanitary and repulsive, and where opportunities
for recreation are limited and
sordid, crime is bound to flourish. Approximately
one-fifth of the persons incarcerated
in Allegheny county in recent
years have been immigrants from southeastern
Europe. A visit to the police
stations of the South Side on Sunday
morning when the police magistrate dispenses
justice after a "wide-awake" Saturday
night, is a thing never to be forgotten.
In such a section the foreigners
form a majority of the offenders. On one
of my visits to a South Side court, a
young Pole was brought up who said he
wanted to be arrested just to find out how
it felt. The judge asked him, "How do
you like it?" "All right," he said laughing.
He got a full taste by being sent to
jail for ten days. Another young Slav
had violated a city ordinance. He could
not speak English. The judge asked him
how long he had been in the country.
"Four years," he replied. "And you cannot
talk English?" said the judge. "Don't
you know that you ought to learn English
that you may know we have laws and
ordinances which must be obeyed?" In
the judge's remark there was more of a
commentary on civic duties unfulfilled
than he perhaps realized. But who was
to blame? Was it the Slav boy? Or was
it the community which had failed to
meet him halfway?</p>

<p>Here it is well to point out that the
public school authorities have not made
any strenuous effort to open evening
schools for foreign adults in the city.
The notable exception to this rule has
been the work carried on by Principal
Anthony among the Jewish people of the
hill district, which grew out of classes
carried on at Columbian Settlement. Another
evening school, in the establishment
of which a priest was the prime mover,
met with fair success, but the foreigners
dropped out very quickly. When asked
why the school was given up, one of the
school officials said that the pupils did not
want it to continue; but their hours of
work and changing shifts are probably
still more important factors. Kingsley
House, Woods Run and Columbian Settlement
have carried on successful classes
for foreigners, and the Y. M. C. A.'s of
the districts are entering the field of civic
and language instruction. The development
of the evening courses of the Carnegie
Technical Schools has been significant,
but as yet they do not reach many
unskilled immigrants, who need a nearby
elementary help. The camp schools
carried on by the Society for the Protection
of Italian Immigrants, at Aspinwall
and Ambridge, have illustrated what
could be done, and the response which
comes from the immigrants themselves.
More important, they were the means
of securing the passage of legislation
enabling local school authorities to
open classes for adults. But in Greater
Pittsburgh, it remains true that the school
authorities are not yet awake to the importance
of opening schools for foreign-speaking
people and inducing them to attend.
There could be no greater service
rendered these young foreigners (or the
city that harbors them) than that of aiding
them to form clubs, and of engaging
competent men to teach them English and
give them some idea of the history and
laws of the country.</p>

<p>In police station No. 3 on Penn avenue,
the cases averaged four hundred and
forty-five a month during the ten months
I studied them. Drunkenness and disorderly
conduct formed sixty-eight per
cent of these cases, and the foreigners
from southeastern Europe were charged
with twenty-seven per cent of them.
Three-quarters of the criminals were
single men, and the large number of
single men among the foreigners who
lack decent homes, doubtless partly accounts
for the frequency of their arrests.
Similar proportions governed at police
station No. 7 on Carson street.</p>

<p>A study of the docket of the Aldermen's
Court on the South Side, in a
prescribed area where Slavs and Lithuanians
form an essential part of the population,
showed a total of 167, or 39.5
per cent for these nationalities; but
these cases varied greatly from those
in the police stations. 48.3 per cent
were cases of assault and battery and
45.6 per cent of the culprits were foreigners.
The cases of fornication and
bastardy, adultery and rape, numbered
seventeen, more than half of which were
to be laid at the door of the foreigners.
Cases of larceny, disturbance of the
peace, and disorderly conduct were about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
equally divided between the English-speaking
and the non-English-speaking
of southeastern Europe. Out of thirty-one
cases of desertion and non-support,
not a Slav, Lithuanian or Italian was
implicated.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SERVIAN GIRL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A closer study of this list indicated that
aldermen were giving preference to cases
where the returns were sure. Pittsburgh
suffers under a system of petty aldermen's
courts such as Chicago only recently
put an end to, and from which
Philadelphia is exempted by constitutional
provision. The aldermen are dependent
upon their fees and the immigrants,
ofttimes innocent, are the special
prey of such as may be unscrupulous.</p>

<p>Profits are not what they used to be
for those who prey upon ignorance, as I
gathered from the constable who told
me, "The foreigner knows too much
now; old times are past." In the good
old times he had made from fifteen to
twenty dollars a day. But even if the
most flagrant abuses are now infrequent
and if some of the aldermen are of
unquestionable character, the system is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
wrong and the foreigner is its most
grievous sufferer.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LITHUANIAN GIRL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But we must not over-estimate the
lawlessness among these people. We have
seen the manner of life of the single
men, and the dangers that beset them.
In the Pittsburgh situation what encouragement
is there to the immigrant who
seriously wants to get ahead in life? I
have it from a priest that one-tenth of
the young men of his race who come to
this district go to the bad; the other
nine-tenths may drink more or less, but
they manage to save money and in time
acquire property. Of the Lithuanian
families of Pittsburgh more than ten
per cent own their own homes. Many
Poles and Slovaks also have purchased
their own homes. When an Italian resolves
to stay in this country, he buys a
house. But as yet few Croatians, Ruthenians
and Servians own real estate in
Pittsburgh. While the wages of the day
laborers in the district are high for the
single man who lives on the boarding
boss system, the foreigner who brings
his family here and pays American prices
for the necessities of life, faces a different
situation. The father of a family cannot
hope to get accommodations for less
than twelve or fifteen dollars a month,
and then he has only two or three rooms.
The Slav, as we have seen, has to pay
more than the English-speaking man for
the same house. The man who earns
thirty-seven dollars a month and has to
pay twelve dollars in rent has not a large
fund on which to raise a family. He belongs
to one or two lodges which means
an outlay of a dollar to a dollar and a
half each month. He must pay fifty
cents a month to his church, and he is
compelled to send his children to the
parochial school at, say, another fifty
cents a head, or three for a dollar. He
must buy the school books needed by
the child; this may amount yearly to
from three to four dollars. Is it surprising,
then, that the children are sent
to work at an early age and that many
are raised in cramped and dirty quarters?
But this question of the children,
of their health and education, we must
leave to later issues. When the mills
are working regularly and the father is
able to work each day, the family manages
to get along. But when sickness
comes or work ceases, then the pinch of
hunger is felt. Mrs. Lippincott of the
Society for the Improvement of the Poor
tells me that in good times but few
Slavs or Lithuanians apply for aid; that
only when the father is killed or injured,
is aid needed, and that then it is for
medicine and proper food for the patient.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> A study of the records of the charity department
of Pittsburgh and Allegheny indicated that
the percentage of foreign born dependents exceeds
by perhaps ten per cent the percentage of
foreign born in the population. I refer to the
city home, the city hospital, the poor houses, the
tuberculosis camp and outdoor relief. In the institutions
for the insane as many as forty-nine
per cent were foreign born and of the $311,470
appropriated for their maintenance on a given
year, half was thus bestowed upon the foreign
born.</p></div>

<p>It must be remembered that influential
men among the Slavs and Lithuanians
are prosperous and live in residential
sections of Pittsburgh. Some Poles
and Italians are in the professions and
some Lithuanians are well to do business
men. All these people, however, do
business among their own countrymen,
and as yet their influence is largely restricted
to this circle. Sections of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>city where foreigners
live are
well supplied
with banking
facilities, which
are generally
conducted by
men of those nationalities.
The
leading banks of
Pittsburgh have
learned that
the immigrants
save their money,
and many
of them have a
foreign exchange
department
at the
head of which
is put a foreign-speaking
man
who is a leader among his countrymen.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is interesting to
examine more closely what might be
called the personal ledger of the Slavic
day laborer in Pittsburgh.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 669px;">

<div class="caption"><p>A SLAVIC HOUSEHOLD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We have seen that more than half the
Italians, Croatians, Servians and Ruthenians
are single men, and that a large
proportion of the other races are similarly
placed. Many are married but their
wives are across the seas. Their policy
is to make all they can and spend as little
as possible. We have also seen that the
wages of common labor are from $1.35
to $1.65 a day and that those who have
acquired a little skill earn from $1.75 to
$2.25. The monthly expenditure of
single men bent on saving will not exceed
ten dollars a month. Some Russians
complain when their monthly bill
amounts to eight dollars. The drinking
bill will not exceed five dollars a month;
and the sum spent on clothing will hardly
equal that. Hence a common laborer
can save from ten to fifteen dollars a
month; the semi-skilled workers from
twenty to twenty-five dollars; and boarding
bosses accumulate what is to them a
competence. A banker doing business
among the Servians of the South Side
stated that each pay day he sent back between
$20,000 and $25,000 to the old
country on deposit. In September of
1907, one of the banks on the South Side
where the foreigners do business had
$600,000 on deposit. Such a showing has
come only after a vigorous campaign on
the part of the banks of Pittsburgh to
overcome the mistrust which foreigners
feel toward private institutions. Individual
small banks conducted by men
of their own nationality were the rule
for many years. The institutions were
ephemeral and the impression prevailed
among the laborers that they were
schemes of sinister men to wheedle their
money from them. Some men still secrete
their savings, trusting no one.</p>

Pittsburgh bankers, this table of twelve

<p>The fraternal organizations also
among the Slavs, Lithuanians and Italians
provoke an increasing amount of
thrift and provide various forms of insurance.
They are the dominant form
of social organization and afford opportunities
for leadership to the stronger
men. The National Slovak Society, for
instance, has a membership of 50,000, and
the Polish National Alliance one of 75,000.
Pittsburgh has some thirty locals
of the latter alone, each with a list of
from forty to 300 members. The lodge
organizations of these people cannot be
discussed in detail in such a paper as
this; here it is sufficient to note that in
case of sickness and death they look
after their members; they provide social
centers for the more thrifty of the people,
and tend generally to raise the standard
of life.</p>

<p>Outside these lodges, the Slavs, Lithuanians
and Italians have their organizations
for enjoyment and amusement.
Among the Poles there are societies for
self-culture, such as dramatic clubs and
singing societies.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the
home governments of these people foster
the formation of organizations along
racial lines; the church also fosters these
national societies. In so far as such organizations
perpetuate national customs
and habits in America, they tend to
make assimilation difficult. A strong
people swayed by racial consciousness on
foreign soil will either thrust its own concepts
and ideals into the social elements
around it and modify them; or it will
build around itself a wall which the customs
and habits of the country will find
difficulty in penetrating. This is seen
going on in Pittsburgh. The Poles and
Italians form a city within a city; their
customs and habits are distinctly Polish
and Italian.</p>

<p>When we come to political life, we
must accord leadership to other than the
Slavic groups,&mdash;to the Italians. A political
leader among them in Pittsburgh
claims that four fifths of all Italians who
have been in the country five years are
naturalized. He held that the Italians
of Pittsburgh poll about 5,000 votes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
which are scattered over eleven wards.
Next to the Italians come the Poles.
Many of them have been voters for years,
but of the influx that has come to Pittsburgh
in the last ten years not twenty
per cent are naturalized. The Polish
vote is set at 4,000 and the Poles have
two or three political clubs. Political
clubs are also found among the Lithuanians
and Croatians. Too frequently
these racial leaders,&mdash;often saloon keepers,&mdash;are
the satellites of some English-speaking
politician, and through them he
controls "the foreign vote." Some of the
more intelligent of the foreign-speaking
are dissatisfied with this manipulation of
their people; among these are rising
young men with political aspirations. It
will not be long before the city will feel
their presence. If the Polish and Italian
votes were to be crystallized in some fifteen
wards, the leaders there would have
the balance of power and control them.</p>

<p>Slavs, Lithuanians and Italians have a
strong religious element in their make-up
which plays a never-ending part in
such racial communities as are to be
found in the Pittsburgh district. Unless
this element is reckoned with they are
not to be understood. The vast majority
belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Some Protestants are found among each
of the races, but they form only a small
percentage.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Certain of the Southern
Slavs are subject to the Patriarch of
Constantinople and the Russians maintain
a Greek Orthodox church. Religious
ceremonies and observances have
strong hold upon the Poles and Lithuanians,
the Croatians and Servians.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
We have seen that the number of males
far exceeds that of females among the
immigrants from southeastern Europe.
This the church attendance corroborates.
I have seen in Pittsburgh a congregation
of one thousand men, all in the prime
of life, so intent upon the religious exercises
that the least movement
of the priest at the altar found
immediate response in every
member of the audience. The
ritual of the church has a deep
hold upon Slav and Lithuanian;
often the men go to confession
at six in the morning
that they may go to communion
the day following. When
men are so employed that they
cannot attend mass on Sundays,
they will attend one on
Saturdays. The home must be
consecrated once a year, and
hundreds take their baskets
laden with provisions to
church on Easter morning that
the priest may bless the feast
they hope to enjoy that day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The Protestant denominations in the city are
conducting mission work among the Slavs and
Italians. Several missionaries, colporteurs and
Bible readers are employed. There are among the
Slovaks, Lithuanians, Magyars and Italians, adherents
of various Protestant churches.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The Roman Catholic Church has not the influence
over the Bohemians and Italians that it has
over the above mentioned people. The Bohemians
are many of them free thinkers. The Italians
are deeply religious but for the most part
lukewarm in their attitude toward the church,
and their edifices do not compare with those of
the Poles.</p></div>

<p>If we measure the efficiency
of the Roman Catholic Church
among the Slavs and Lithuanians
in Pittsburgh by money
spent on buildings and maintenance,
it cannot be equalled
either by American Catholicism
or Protestantism. The
people give freely of their hard earnings
to erect costly church edifices and support
the priesthood. The Slavs and Lithuanians
have been on the South Side of
Pittsburgh only for the last twenty years,
but to-day they possess church property
valued at three-quarters of a million dollars,
and most of it is paid for. They also
give toward the erection of parochial
schools and maintain them.</p>

<p>The priests have great power over the
lives of their people. Some of them are
charged with accumulating riches, but
taken as a whole, I view them as a body
of men loyal to their vows and honoring
the profession wherein they serve.
With the great numbers constantly coming
from Europe, it is surprising how
carefully they keep in touch with the
newcomers. Slav and Lithuanian priests
whose parishes are constantly changing
take a census each year. They know the
affairs of their people. They know their
housing conditions, their hardships in
mine and mill; are familiar with the
wrongs they suffer. In trouble the
priests are their counselors; they sympathize
with them in their struggles;
they institute and manage
insurance societies against
sickness and accident. Some
of the priests found and control
building and loan associations.
They at all times stimulate
their people to rise to the
level of other people around
them. The priests are busy
men. A parish of two thousand
or three thousand means
endless activities. With the
influx of Slavs and Lithuanians
into the country, and
the necessity of organizing
parishes where many of them
settle, the difficulty has been
to secure properly qualified
priests to take charge of the
work. Hence, many of the
Slav and Lithuanian clergy
are overworked and no assistance
can be furnished them.
Their influence lies first with
the adults who come from the
fatherland. The children are
not as amenable to the discipline
of the church; neither do they
give their earnings as freely to its support.
The growing problem of the
church is to meet the religious needs of
people of Slavic blood raised in a new
country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This sketch,&mdash;brief though it is,&mdash;of
the foreign-speaking peoples of Pittsburgh
shows clearly how dependent the
industries are upon a supply of able bodied
men from Europe. The enterprising
from agricultural communities freely
bring their strength to the expansion of
American industries, and never was there
an army more docile and willing than
these newcomers. They believe in mutual
protection and organize and conduct
various societies for this purpose. They
find their pleasure in many crude ways.
They are loyal to their church, and the
many churches owned by them represent
offerings made by men who literally earn
their bread by the sweat of their brow.
Many of them save money and the number
of those who own their homes is annually
increasing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></p>

<p>There are imperative needs of this element
of the city's population which must
be met if the cause of civilization is to
be served. The fatal and non-fatal injuries
of the mills fall heavily upon these
peoples. Each week a tale of wrong and
suffering, agony and death, is sent across
the water, which seriously reflects upon
the industrial life of America. The value
placed on human life here will not bear
comparison with that of older countries
whose civilization we say is lower
than ours. The great need of the hour
is a current and detailed
record of the
serious accidents of
the district, that the
public may know
exactly at what cost
of life and limb industry
is carried
on, and may exhaust
every means
for lessening the
sacrifice.</p>

<img src="images/fig060.jpg" width="546" height="680" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A SLAVIC LABORER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We saw that the
housing conditions
of many of these
peoples are a disgrace
to civilization.
The insufficiency
of houses,
the greed of landlords,
the exigencies
of some foreigners
and the
penury of others,
bring about this
condition. There should be stricter regulation
of immigrant boarding houses.
Men who coin money in shacks and those
foreign born who are too greedy to pay
for decent quarters, should feel the firm
hand of the law. Crowding, dirt and filth
are not American and should not be tolerated
in any American city.</p>

<p>But negative work is not enough; positive
and aggressive work must be done
if the foreign-speaking are to rise to the
measure of their opportunity. Every nationality
has its aesthetic side, and Pittsburgh
has done nothing to bring this to
the fore. Other cities have fostered the
national dance, have encouraged works
of art, and have induced the foreigner to
show the artistic side of his nature. Cannot
this be done in Pittsburgh? Give
these people a chance to bring out their
needle-work, to show their artistic skill,
to sing their national songs, and to dance
their native dances, and the life of the
city will be richer and stronger.</p>

<p>Then why should the people who gave
Lafayette a welcome that has become
historical, and who
championed the cause
of Kossuth, not go
forth in sympathy to
these people of Slav
and Iberic extraction?
They are left
in ignorance of our
language, our laws,
our government,
and our history.
This rich inheritance
we cherish,
and we believe it is
more excellent than
any of which the
older countries of
Europe can boast.
If this be so, is it
not our privilege
and duty to train
these peoples of
southeastern
Europe in the principles
of democracy?
Thousands of these peoples yearn
for a knowledge of our language and
an insight into that form of government
that has made America great among
the nations of the earth, and we should
be willing to go half way and meet the
need.</p>

<p>The public school can take up this
work with greater zeal; the social
agencies of all sorts can stretch the cords
of their tents and take in the men who
are anxious to learn.</p>

<p>It is estimated that between 70,000
and 80,000 men are employed in the
manufacture of steel in Allegheny county.
Their homes are clustered about the
mills along the rivers, they are clinging
to the bluffs of the South Side, and they
are scattered over Greater Pittsburgh,
from Woods Run to the East End. Up
the Monongahela valley are the mill-towns,&mdash;Homestead
of Pinkerton fame,
Braddock with its record-breaking mills
and furnaces, Duquesne where the unit
of weight is a hundred tons, and McKeesport,
home of the "biggest tube

of Kossuth and Kosciusko, still seeking

steady employment. Here are English,

of men who fought at Gettysburg.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This is a description of leading types of steel
workers. A discussion of the labor problem in
the steel industry is reserved for a later number.</p></div>

<p>Fully sixty-five per cent of these men
are unskilled, but the remaining thirty-five
per cent, the skilled and semi-skilled,
are the men who give character to the industry.
This is the class from which
foremen and superintendents and even
the steel presidents have been recruited,
and it is the class that furnishes the
brains of the working force. It is of
them that I write. To know these men
you must see them at work; you must
stand beside the open-hearth helper as
he taps fifty tons of molten steel from
his furnace, you must feel the heat of the
Bessemer converters as you watch the
vessel-men and the steel pourer, and
above the crash and roar of the blooming
mills you must talk with rollers and
hookers, while five-and ten-ton steel
ingots plunge madly back and forth between
the rolls. You must see the men
working in hoop mills and guide mills,
where the heat is intense and the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>laborious; you must see them amid ladles
of molten steel, among piles of red hot
bars, or bending over the straightening
presses at the rail mills.</p>

<p>But to know them best you should see
them at home. There the muscular feats
of the heater's helper and the rough orders
of the furnace boss are alike forgotten,
and you find a kindly, open-hearted,
human sort of men. You grow into an
understanding of them as they tell of
hopes and plans or mistakes and failures,
and understanding becomes sympathy as
it comes home to you how close some
half-spoken disappointment presses in
upon them. It was in this way that for
nine or ten months I lived among the
steel workers, and came to number some
of them as friends.</p>

<p>The skilled workers are generally of
Anglo-Saxon, German or Keltic origin,
the largest proportion being American
born. They are not educated, so far as
school and university training are concerned,
but they are post graduates in
the school of experience.</p>

<p>The visitor in a steel mill sees only
faces reddened by the glare of fire and
hot steel, muscles standing out in knots
and bands on bare arms, clothing frayed
with usage and begrimed by machinery.
The men do not differ materially
from other workmen, and the
visitor passes on and forgets them. The
world is full of men in greasy overalls.
But a workman is not merely a workman,
any more than a business man is
merely a business man. He is also a
man, whether he works in a mill or sits
at a desk. So I shall introduce some of
these men and let them talk to you, as
they talked to me. Bear in mind
that the things they talk about could
be taken up from another point of
view. In the following interviews I am
making no interpretation of the workers
from the employer's standpoint.
These are the issues of life as seen by
the men themselves.</p>

<p>POURING MOLTEN IRON, JUST TAPPED FROM BLAST FURNACE, INTO BESSEMER CONVERTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Jack Griswold is a Scotch-Irish furnace
boss who came to America and got
a laborer's position at a Pittsburgh blast
furnace, when the common labor force
was largely Irish. Those were the days
before the advent of the "furriners." I
sat in Griswold's sitting room in his
four-room cottage one evening and he
told me about the men who work at the
furnaces, and about the "long turn."</p>

<p>"Mighty few men have stood what I
have, I can tell you. I've been twenty
years at the furnaces and been workin'
a twelve-hour day all that time, seven
days in the week. We go to work at
seven in the mornin' and we get through
at night at six. We work that way for
two weeks and then we work the long
turn and change to the night shift. The
long turn is when we go on at seven
Sunday mornin' and work through the
whole twenty-four hours up to Monday
mornin'. That puts us onto the night
turn for the next two weeks, and the
other crew onto the day. The next time
they get the long turn and we get twenty-four
hours off, but it don't do us much
good. I get home at about half past seven
Sunday mornin' and go to bed as
soon as I've had breakfast. I get
up about noon so as to get a
bit o' Sunday to enjoy, but I'm
tired and sleepy all the afternoon. Now,
if we had eight hours it would be different.
I'd start to work, say, at six and
I'd be done at two and I'd come home,
and after dinner me and the missus
could go to the park if we wanted to,
or I could take the childer to the country
where there ain't any saloons. That's
the danger,&mdash;the childer runnin' on the
streets and me with no time to take them
any place else. That's what's driven the
Irish out of the industry. It ain't the
Hunkies,&mdash;they couldn't do it,&mdash;but the
Irish don't have to work this way. There
was fifty of them here with me sixteen
years ago and now where are they? I
meet 'em sometimes around the city,
ridin' in carriages and all of them wearin'
white shirts, and here I am with these
Hunkies. They don't seem like men to
me hardly. They can't talk United
States. You tell them something and
they just look and say 'Me no fustay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
me no fustay.' That's all you can get
out of 'em. And I'm here with them
all the time, twelve hours a day and every
day and I'm all alone,&mdash;not a mother's
son of 'em that I can talk to. Everybody
says I'm a fool to stay here,&mdash;I
dunno, mebbe I am. It don't make so
much difference though. I'm gettin'
along, but I don't want the kids ever to
work this way. I'm goin' to educate
them so they won't have to work twelve
hours."</p>

<p>There is a considerable difference between
a blast furnace foreman and a Bessemer
steel pourer. The furnace man
gets rather low wages, while the steel
pourer is well paid and works eight
hours a day for six days in the week.
It was Jerry Flinn who told me how
he had worked up from his first job as
laborer, to a position as steel pourer. I
met him just as he got home from the
mill one day, and I asked how he managed
to work only an eight-hour shift
when other men had to work twelve. He
told me that attempts have been made to
introduce a twelve-hour day in the converting
department but without success.
Two Pittsburgh mills have tried it and
both went back to eight hours because
the heat is so great as to make it impossible
for the men to work that long.</p>

<p>"It must be hard," said Flinn, "for the
twelve-hour men to have to work alongside
of us eight-hour men. During the
twelve hours of their day they work
with all three crews of the eight-hour
men. One crew gets through and goes
home soon after the twelve-hour men
come out, the next crew works its eight
hours and goes home, and the third crew
comes out before those twelve-hour fellows
can quit. The eight-hour men get
a lot more pleasure out of life than the
twelve-hour men do. We can go to
entertainments and social affairs as we
couldn't if we had to get up next morning
and go to work at six o'clock."</p>

<p>Flinn is fifty-two years old, and tells
you his strength is not up to what it was,
say fifteen years ago. The men who
went to work with him as young men
are nearly all dead, and to-day he is one
of the oldest men in his mill. He speaks
lightly of the danger of accidents, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
says that he has encountered only the
minor ones. Once when they were
changing stoppers, the crane dropped
the old one just as it swung clear of the
edge of the ladle. It fell on him, burning
him and breaking his leg. At another
time he failed to lower the stopper
in time, and the stream of molten steel
struck the edge of a mold as the train
was shifted; it splashed onto the platform,
burning his legs so severely that,
for six weeks afterwards, he was unable
to turn over in bed. It is a common
thing for metal to fly that way; the
sparks strike his face, they lodge in his
nose or his ears, and once he nearly lost
the sight of an eye. He refers to these
things as trifles.</p>

<p>What I said of the half concealed disappointments
which are real and tragic
in the life of a steel worker, would have
been clear to you had you heard the story
of Robert Smith, as he told it himself.
As a boy he went to work in the coal
mines of eastern Pennsylvania and did
not get into the mills until he was about
thirty years old. Then he came to Pittsburgh,
took a laborer's position, and began
to work up slowly year after year
until he occupied a place of some importance,
though not in the first class of
skilled men. After he had been there a
few years, there was a labor difficulty in
this mill and he left and went to another
plant where he took a position similar to
his last one. As a new man he could
not advance as rapidly as he might have
done in the old mill, and before he
could get into the best of standing, he
was thrown out of work by further labor
troubles. He secured a position in another
mill where he remained for two
years till forced out by a strike to seek
work in a fourth mill. Here he remained
for ten years in a subordinate position.
At the end of that time, he was
promoted and became for the first
time in his life, the first man in the crew.
Then, in some way, he incurred the dislike
of the superintendent, and the man
on the opposite shift worked against him
because he wanted Smith's job for a
friend.</p>

<p>So, after working for three years in a
position for which, as he said, he had
served a ten years' apprenticeship, Smith
again lost his place and was obliged to
apply for work in still another mill. He
had been a leader in the union, and it was
a feeling almost religious in its devotion
that bound him to it. To get into this
new mill he had to agree to give up his
union card. To-day he says that he is
a strong union man at heart, but his connection
with it is over. Now, at nearly
sixty years of age, he is working in a
semi-skilled position, although fitted to
take his place among the men of the best
skill and to handle a crew.</p>

<p>Smith is a man of more than ordinary
intelligence. He is a man of religious
inclinations and a church member. He
regrets the twelve-hour day now chiefly
on the ground that it keeps the young
men away from church. If he had not
become a church-member when he had
an eight-hour day, he doesn't see how
he ever could have become interested in
religious matters. He lives in a comfortable
home which he owns and where
he spends most of his time when not in
the mill. After supper he sits down to
read for a short time before going to
bed, but he told me with considerable regret
that he was unable to do any systematic
reading. A few years ago he
read several of Shakespeare's plays, but
he had to force himself to do it, he gets
sleepy so soon after supper. Since that
time he has not attempted anything more
serious than the daily paper.</p>

<p>Of course, the question of organized
labor suggests a number of other considerations.
The old union attitude towards
employers is not of consequence
now in Pittsburgh, for most of the steel
mills of the district have been non-union
for ten or fifteen years. This fact, however,
makes it all the more worth while
to consider the present attitude of the
men as individuals.</p>

<p>Jim Barr is a man thirty-five years
old who came from England when he
was a small boy. It has been only during
the last ten years or so that Barr
has worked in a steel mill, but he has
lived in the steel district longer than that.
He occupies a skilled position in one
of the mills where he works every day
but Sundays from seven in the morning
until six in the evening, and on alternate
Sundays he has the long turn of twenty-four
hours. This Sunday work, he told
me, came in after the union had been
driven out, and the twelve-hour day is
more general now than it was under
unionism.</p>

<p>PITTSBURGH TYPES.</p>

<p>OF THE OLD TIME IRISH IMMIGRATION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Tell me, how can a man get any pleasure
out of life working that way?" Barr
asked me almost with a challenge. We
were sitting before the grate in his comfortable
and tastefully furnished parlor.
There were pictures on the wall, a carpet
on the floor, and the piano in the corner
spoke of other things than endless drudgery.
He seemed to interpret my swift
glance about the room, for he went on,
"I've got as good a home here as a man
could want. It's comfortable and I enjoy
my family. But I only have these things
to think about, not to enjoy. I'm at work
most of the day, and I'm so tired at night
that I just go to bed as soon as I've eaten
supper. I have ideas of what a home
ought to be, all right, but the way things
are now I just eat and sleep here."</p>

<p>Barr works in a position where he encounters
considerable heat, and he says
that alone is very exhausting even when
a man does not do hard physical labor.
There is great danger, too, in the sweat
that keeps a man's clothing wet all of
the time. If he gets into a draught he
is likely to contract a cold or pneumonia.
Working under such conditions shortens
a man's life, to Barr's mind, and although
he is but thirty-five years old he tells you
he feels a decline in his strength. The
men find that it costs more to live, too,
when working in the mills, for they
need the best of food and the warmest
clothing in order to keep going. The
little chance for recreation leads them to
the saloons as the natural place for relaxation.
They go there much oftener,
in his opinion, than they would if they
had more time for social enjoyment; and
of course there is a good deal of money
spent there that is needed for other
things. He says that men frequently
spend twenty dollars in a single night
after payday. But the thing on which
Barr seems to have the strongest convictions
is the plan of the United States
Steel Corporation of issuing stock to employes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p>"The men have been fooled by this
proposition," he declared, "and they really
believe that the corporation wants to
do big things for them in offering such
liberal dividends. But let me tell you
something that maybe you haven't noticed.
The first stock issued in 1903
was followed by a slashing cut in wages
in 1904, and it amounted to a lot more
than the extra dividends. It's only a
scheme to fool the men. They take
away in wages more than what they
give in dividends and they will do that
every time, so that the corporation is
always ahead of the game. But that
isn't the only thing; it ties the employes
down to the corporation. They've got
to stay in its employ at least five years
from the time of getting the stock in order
to enjoy all of the benefits, and even
then they won't get the extra dividends
unless they have shown what the corporation
calls a 'proper interest' in its
affairs. It's a fine scheme for keeping
out unionism and keeping the men from
protesting against bad conditions."</p>

<p>Now, just by way of contrast, listen to
the story of George Hudson, who occupies
a position similar to that of Barr, and
has been in mill work about the same
length of time. After having tried another
line and found it unsatisfactory,
Hudson came to the mills at about thirty
years of age. He did what American
young men dislike very much to do,&mdash;he
took a common laborer's position along
with the "Hunkies." Being a man of
perseverance and some education, he
worked up very rapidly until he now occupies
a skilled position.</p>

<p>"The Steel Corporation is a fine one
to work for," said Hudson to me with
enthusiasm. "It gives every man a
chance for promotion, and listens to
every workman who has a plan for improvement.
All the intelligent men are
satisfied. If you can find any dissatisfied
men, you will find that they are men
who would be discontented anywhere
you put them. Take the way they
loan money to men who want to build
homes. A good many men have their
own cottages now just because the company
helped them. The company has
a savings department too, and it pays
five per cent on all deposits, and that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
more than the savings banks pay. Then,
on the other hand, it charges only five
per cent interest on the money that is
loaned, and that is a lower rate than you
can get anywhere else. The company
owns houses which it rents to employes
at thirty per cent or more below what
other people charge. I pay twenty-five
dollars rent, and I've got a friend in a
company house which is better than mine,
and he only pays eighteen." Hudson is
ambitious and he was very proud that
his department during recent months
had succeeded in beating all previous
records known.</p>

<p>To turn to the second question raised
by Smith in our talk before his fire,&mdash;if
number of organizations is any criterion
the churches in the mill towns
must be strong. I found a considerable
number of loyal church members among
the steel workers. Those of them who
have to work on Sunday chafe under the
necessity that drives them to such a disregarding
of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Especially does this bear heavily on
the wife who must attend church alone,
while her husband is in the mill or at
the furnaces. A Scotch Presbyterian
mother at a home where I called one
afternoon just as the man was preparing
to go to the mill for the night, spoke
regretfully of having left Scotland.
They might not have been able to live
so well there, but "Oh, man, we could
have brought up the children in the fear
o' God and in a land where men reverence
the Sabbath." There are men like
Smith, too, who fear the effect of twelve-hour
work on the lives of the boys.</p>

<p>In spite of this religious sentiment
that exists among the workers there is,
on the other hand, a good deal of feeling
that the churches do not understand the
needs of the workingmen. Frank Robinson,
for instance, believes that the
churches are not interested in some
problems that are to him very real.</p>

<p>"There are a good many churches in
this borough," he said to me one day,
"and they are supported generally by the
women. The preachers don't have any
influence in securing better conditions
for the men,&mdash;they don't try to have.
They never visit the mills, and they don't
know anything about the conditions the
men have to face. They think the men
ought to go to church after working
twelve hours Saturday night. The
preachers could accomplish a lot if they
would try to use their influence in the
right direction; let them quit temperance
reform until they get better conditions
for the men. It's no time to preach to
a man when he's hungry; feed him first,
then preach to him. The same thing
with a workingman; get a decent working
day with decent conditions, then ask
him to stop drinking. Let the preachers
go into the mills and see the men at
work in the heat, and outside the mills
let them notice the men with crushed
hands or broken arms or with a leg missing.
If they would stop their preaching
long enough to look around a little
they could do something for us, if they
wanted to try."</p>

<p>There seems to be some reason for
such a feeling. I talked with ministers
in some of the mill towns who knew very
little of the problems of the workingmen
or of the conditions under which they
work. Some of them said that they had
never been inside the mills, and, of
course, such men cannot be entirely sympathetic.
Of a different sort was another
minister whom I met who had
been a mill-man himself. He had gone into
mill work as a boy and had worked
up through a common laborer's position
to a skilled job before he left the mill to
go to college. I have met few men with
more understanding and sympathy for
the working-men's problems.</p>

<p>Unionism is not entirely dead in the
mill towns; at least the spirit of it is
to be found among the men, though the
form is absent. Some of them expect
to see an organization in the mills again.
Others have given up hope of gaining
shorter hours or higher wages through
collective bargaining, and are looking
for government interference and a legal
eight-hour day. There is considerable
variety of opinion as to how this is to
be brought about. Pittsburgh steel
workers are traditionally republican in
politics; Speaker Cannon himself does
not fear "tinkering" with the tariff
more than they. The majority of them
have been hoping that their representatives
would get time after a while to
consider and pass the labor legislation
that the workingmen desire. However,
there has been much loss of faith
in the last few years.</p>

<p>A good many men in the mills are
socialists at heart, and though they still
vote the republican ticket, they would
vote with the socialists if that party were
to manifest strength enough to give it a
chance at carrying an election. A considerable
number of others have gone
the whole way and are active working
socialists. One of these is Ed. Jones,
a skilled steel worker. He was left an
orphan, came to Pittsburgh from New
York as a boy of eighteen years, and
worked for a short time as a laborer in
one of the mills. After trying his hand
at several unskilled trades he went back
to a small mill in New York, where his
wages were $1.25 a day. He was determined
to work up in the industry, and
after a year or so as a laborer he found
himself in a semi-skilled position with
wages correspondingly better. A year
or two later he returned to Pittsburgh
and became a full fledged skilled man at
$5 a day. Since then, in spite of reverses,
he has worked up slowly until
now he holds one of the most important
positions in his mill. Jones has never
been a union man. He says he does not
believe in unions because they accomplish
things only in prosperous times,
and go to pieces in a panic. "It is no
use for them to try to regulate wages,
anyhow," he says, "for labor is a commodity
and its price is regulated by supply
and demand. The only way out for
the laboring men is to get together in a
labor party,"&mdash;and this to him means
the socialist party.</p>

<p>"We must go back to the condition
when workmen owned their own tools,"
declares Jones. "We must own the instruments
of production. Labor is now
the helpless victim of capital, and capital
must be overthrown. The workman is
given enough to buy food and clothes
for himself, and no more if the capitalist
can help himself. They keep these workmen
employed twelve hours a day at
some work, while if every man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
country would work two hours a day, all
the labor that would be necessary to support
the population of the country could
be performed. Now all of this excess,
these ten hours over the necessary
amount, goes to the employer in profits,
and many people throughout the country
are living in idleness because other
people are working overtime for them."
Jones is in comfortable circumstances
himself; he owns his house and he owns
some United States Steel stock, but he
says he is one out of thirty-eight men
in his whole plant who could have done
as well.</p>

<p>One of the near-socialists who hopes
for both unionism and for governmental
relief, gave me a statement of his belief
one Sunday afternoon as I sat in a comfortable
chair in his little parlor. "I
think there will be a labor organization
in the mills again," he said. "It may not
come in our day, but it is bound to
come; the men will be driven to it. There
would be a union now but for the foolishness
of the men. They begin to talk
as soon as a movement is started, and of
course the news reaches the ears of the
bosses before the organization is really
on its feet. Then the men, who are not
in a position to resist, are threatened with
discharge. That has happened in this
very mill. It may be that political action
will be necessary before a union
will be possible. There are two things
that we've got to have: an eight-hour
day and restriction of immigration. I
think that we will have to get together in
a labor party. I'm not a socialist, myself,
though quite a good many of the
mill men are, and there are a good many
things about socialism that I like, all
right. I would vote with them if I
thought they were going to win and there
are others who feel the same way. I
used to vote the republican ticket, but
I'm tired of it. They haven't done
much for the workingmen when you consider
the length of time they've been in
power. I'm disgusted with the whole
thing and I haven't voted at all for several
years."</p>

<p>Several of the men had said to me:
"Go to see Joe Reed; he can tell you more
about the mills than anyone else." So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
one day I climbed the hill to his home,
and found him. I had been led to expect
a good deal and was not disappointed,
though he was just recovering from
an illness and was unable to talk as much
as I had hoped. Reed is just the man
that one would pick as a leader,&mdash;six feet
tall, broad shouldered, with strong intellectual
features,&mdash;and he was in truth
a leader of the Amalgamated Association
years ago, before the steel mills became
non-union. He took a prominent
part in a strike that was of considerable
importance in the steel district. He is a
skilled man and if he had cast his lot
with the company in the dispute, it is
quite likely that he would have best served
his own interests. But he stayed by
the men and when the strike was
lost, Reed left the steel district. He
might have had his former position
again, but he was too proud to ask for
it, and lived away from Pittsburgh until
the bitterness engendered by the struggle
had begun to die out. After several
years he came back and got a job again
in a Pittsburgh steel mill. It is a non-union
mill and of course Reed is a non-union
man.</p>

<p>Reed told me some of his experiences
and how during the strike he had received
letters of encouragement from all
over the country, from men prominent
in many walks of life. I asked him
what he had done with them. He shook
his head. "I burned them," he said,
"when I came back to the mills.
I have nothing in my possession now
which would suggest in any way that I
ever had connection with the union.
When I came back here, I knew I was
coming to a non-union mill and I took a
job in good faith as a non-union man.
That is a chapter in the history of my
life that is ended. The whole matter of
unionism is a thing of the past and as
an employe in this mill, I have no part
in it." This fine sense of honor in conforming
to the new regime is not so
unusual among this class as one might
expect.</p>

<p>So these are the steel workers. I
have not chosen extreme cases; on the
contrary, it has been my aim to select
men who are typical of a class,&mdash;the serious,
clear-headed men, rather than the
irresponsibles,&mdash;and with one exception,
each case is fairly representative of a
large group. The exception is the man
whom I called Hudson. Not over three
men out of the hundred and more with
whom I talked at length indicated like
sentiments, and he is the only one who
gave them such full expression. It should
be understood that these are the skilled
men,&mdash;it is only among the skilled that
opinion is so intelligently put forth.</p>

<p>The number of positions requiring
skill is not large, relatively speaking, and
competition for them is keen. The consequence
is that the skilled workers are
a picked body of men. Through a
course of natural selection the unfit have
been eliminated and the survivors are
exceptionally capable and alert of mind,
their wits sharpened by meeting and
solving difficulties. Such a disciplinary
process has developed men like John Jarrett,
consul at Birmingham during Harrison's
administration; Miles Humphreys,
for two terms chief of the Pennsylvania
Bureau of Industrial Statistics,
one-time nominee of the Republican
party for mayor of Pittsburgh, and now
chief of the fire department of the Smoky
City; M. M. Garland, collector of customs
for Pittsburgh, under both McKinley
and Roosevelt; A. R. Hunt, general
superintendent at Homestead; and
Taylor Alderdice, vice-president of the
National Tube Company.</p>

<p>In telling about their fellows who are
numbered to-day among the rank and
file, I have tried to introduce the leading
types,&mdash;the twelve-hour man with the
eight-hour man, the embittered man and
the contented man, the man who is at
outs with the church, the union man and
the socialist. There are many others
who talk and think like Flinn and Smith
and Robinson, and I could furnish examples
of much more radical thought
and speech. These are typical cases representing
different degrees of skill and
different shades of opinion. It is highly
significant that there are such men as
these in the Pittsburgh mills. In a discussion
of the labor problem in the steel
industry, it must be borne in mind that
these men are more than workers; they
are thinkers, too, and must be reckoned
with.</p>

<p>To study industrial accidents from the
"home" side has been my business for a
year. To acquaint myself daily with
households doubly disabled by sickness
and loss of income, to see strong men,
just learning to face life maimed, to visit
home after home, where sudden death
has visited,&mdash;a dreadful business, you
might say. Yet it has left with me impressions
of personality, character, and
spirit, which make the year's work a
precious experience.</p>

<p>The first thing brought home to me
was that working people do not have "the
luxury of grief." The daily tyranny of
hard work in their lives, leaves little time
for pondering the unanswerable "Why?"
of sorrow.</p>

<p>For instance, Mrs. Dennison, the widow
of a brakeman who was killed on the
Pennsylvania Railroad, spent no quiet
days of solitary mourning. She was left
with six children, the oldest eleven. All
the money she had was $500 from the
Railroad Relief Association,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to which
her husband had belonged, $450 which
the men on her husband's division raised,
and $30 which his own crew gave. The
company gave her $20 toward the funeral.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The company pays the running expenses of this
association.</p></div>

<p>With some of this money she rented
and stocked up a little candy and notion
store, using the three rooms in the back
to live in. Here she tended store, and
cooked, and sewed, and ironed, for herself
and the six. She would have done
her own washing too, she told me, but
she couldn't leave the store long enough
to hang her clothes up in the yard. She
made a reasonable success of the enterprise,
enough to pay for rent and food,
until the hard times came. After that
she steadily lost money. So now she has
put in her application for a chance to
clean cars for the railroad at $1.21 a
day. For this privilege she must wait
her turn among the other widows; and
when she gets it she must leave her children
in one another's care from six in the
morning till six at night. They are now
two, four, six, eight, ten, and twelve, respectively.
Mrs. Dennison will not have
time to sit down and grieve over the
death of her husband for many years to
come.</p>

<p>One mother, whose thin face haunts
me, has been able to endure her tragedy
only through this necessity of work. She
had a daughter, just seventeen, who was
employed in the dressmaking department
of one of the big stores in Pittsburgh.
This girl, Ella, was eager and gay, with
a heart full of kindness. She was everybody's
favorite in the workroom; at home
she meant laughter and good will for
them all. To her mother, Ella was joy
and gladness,&mdash;life itself. One morning
this little dressmaker, after leaving her
wraps on the eleventh floor, found that
she was a few moments late. She ran for
the elevator to go to her workroom above.
The elevator was just starting up, with
the door half closed. Ella tried to make
it, slipped, and fell down the shaft.</p>

<p>This tragedy demoralized the working
force of the store for two days. In the
hunted, suffering eyes of the mother one
reads that she cannot forget, night or
day. She feels that Ella's employers
were generous in giving her $500, but it
would make no difference "if they gave
her the whole store." In the back of her
mind are always two visions alternating,&mdash;the
merry girl who sat eating her
breakfast at a corner of the kitchen table
that morning, laughing and teasing her
mother, and then, as she ran out to take
the car, looked back to smile and say
goodbye,&mdash;this is one. The other,&mdash;that
unthinkable fall down eleven stories and
the crash at the bottom of the shaft. I
felt that nothing but the daily insistence
of work,&mdash;cooking and washing for her
husband and two grown sons, and caring
for the two younger children,&mdash;had saved
this mother's reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span></p>

<p>Another striking instance of the pressure
of work in poor people's lives was in
the family of Harry Nelson. They lived
on the South Side, near the Jones and
Laughlin Steel Works, where the father
and two grown sons and Harry, who was
nineteen, were employed. Two younger
boys were in school. One Sunday night,
on the way home after his twelve hours'
work, Harry said to his father that he'd
"give a lot" not to go back to the mill
that night. (There was another twelve
hours' work to come before he could
sleep, for this was Harry's "double
shift.") He didn't tell his mother he was
tired, because he knew she would beg
him not to go back to work. Harry
was ambitious; he was an electrician's
helper, getting fifteen dollars a week, and
he did not want to lose his job. At 7:30
he was back in the mill, and at 8:00 he
was up on an electric crane, making some
repairs. When he was through he started
along the narrow run-way of the
crane to a place where he could climb
down. The air was full of steam; some
say that he was blinded by this; others,
that he must have been a little dizzy. At
any rate, to steady himself, he reached
for an electric wire that was strung along
there. He happened to touch a part that
was not insulated, got a slight shock, and
fell thirty-five feet to the floor of the
mill.</p>

<p>After Harry was killed, the two older
boys left the mill and looked for work in
another city. But the father had no
choice; he was too old to find new work.
His fifteen a week was all the more indispensable
now because Harry had given
all his money to his mother, and the two
older boys had paid generously for board.
In three days the father was back in his
old place at the cold saw, within sight
of the place where Harry fell.</p>

<p>Thus work may be a cruelty as well
as a blessing. But in any case it leaves
the workers little time to dwell upon their
misfortunes. When they do speak of
them, it is almost always in a "matter-of-course"
way. This is not, I think, because
they lack feeling, but because they
are so used to trouble that the thought
of it has ceased to rouse them.</p>

<p>That poor people are used to trouble
is a commonplace. I mean by "trouble,"
the less subtle disappointments of life,
those which come with disease, injury
and premature death. Of all these
rougher blows of fortune, the poor family
gets more than an even share. This
stands to reason, if experience has not
already convinced one of it. To the ordinary
causes of sickness,&mdash;unsanitary
dwellings, overcrowding, undue exposure,
overwork, lack of necessary vacation,
work under poisonous conditions,&mdash;to all
these poor people are much more constantly
exposed than others. To injury
and death caused by accident they are
also more exposed. Poor people's children
play in dangerous places, on the
street, near railroad tracks. The poor
man's dwelling is not often fire-proof.
Poor people do most of the hazardous
work in the world, and the accidents connected
with work form the majority of
all accidents.</p>

<p>Moreover, the poor family is, in a material
way, less able to meet these disasters
when they come, than the well-to-do
family. This is in some degree due to ignorance,
for ignorance, whether as cause
or result, almost always goes with poverty.
In a very large degree, however,
it is due to poverty itself. It is because
they have no reserve fund to fall back on
in emergencies. Suppose a young steel
worker with a family gets a long, sharp
chip of steel in his eye. He cannot go to
the best specialist, to the man who knows
all that anybody knows about saving eyes.
Through ignorance or lack of interest on
the part of the doctor who treats him, he
loses his eye. Thus an injury which
might mean but a few weeks of fearful
anxiety to a well-to-do man, may result
in lasting misery to a poor man. In the
same way, too, what might often be in a
well-to-do family a short struggle with
disease, crowned with success, is more
likely to be in a poor family an unrelieved
tragedy.</p>

<p>Thus are the poor, by reason of their
very poverty, not only more open to attack
from these bodily foes, but also, and
again by reason of their poverty, less
equipped to fight and conquer them. "St.
George killed the dragon; St. George
wore the finest armor of his day and his
sword was tested steel."</p>

<p>With these workers whom I met,&mdash;poor
people, not as the charity visitor
knows them, but poor, as the rank and
file of wage earners are poor,&mdash;misfortune
is almost part of the regular course
of things. They are used to hard knocks,
if not yet in their own lives, then in the
lives of their relatives, friends, and neighbors.
Consequently, there is often in
their attitude toward trouble a certain
matter-of-fact calmness, which looks like
indifference. Thus, I have had a mother
tell me about her sixteen-year-old son's
losing two fingers in the mill. She
couldn't remember exactly how or when
it happened; she thought he had lost only
a week's work; and she had no comment
upon it but that it might have been worse.
An old steel worker whom I questioned
about his injuries answered, "I
never got hurt any to speak of." After
persistent inquiry, however, he recalled
that he had once fractured his skull, that
a few years later he had lost half of a
finger, and that only three years ago he
was laid up for nine weeks with a crushed
foot. Troubles like these are the common
lot; they are not treasured up and
remembered against fate.</p>

<p>Often I have found in young women a
surprisingly "middle-aged" way of looking
at trouble. I remember, for instance,
Mrs. Coleman, whose husband was a
freight conductor. They had been married
nine years, and had made out pretty
well up to the last two years, although
the wife, as she somewhat proudly explained,
had had three children, two miscarriages,
and an operation, during this
time. On Christmas night, 1903, Coleman
had his arm crushed in a railroad
accident. He was disabled for three
months, and went back to work with a
partially crippled arm. Three weeks later,
as he was numbering cars, an iron bar
rolled off the load and broke his nose.
This laid him up again for five weeks, and
left his face permanently disfigured. He
has been troubled ever since with nose-bleeding,
so that he has to lay off every
little while, and the doctor says he must
have an operation before he can be cured.
Since this second injury, a fourth child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
has come. When I saw her, Mrs. Coleman
was just recovering from a bad attack
of grip, which had increased their
expenses. To help along in this hard
luck time they took two railroad men to
lodge and board in their three room flat;
one of these men had been killed on the
road the week before I called. Here are
troubles enough, and yet this young woman
had no special complaint against fortune.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, as she rose to open
the door for me, the last baby dangling
over one arm,&mdash;"we've had a bad time
these last two years, and now with him
only working two or three days a week, I
guess it'll be worse. But then,"&mdash;with a
smile, "what can you do about it?"</p>

<p>On the same day I talked with a much
older woman. She was too worn out to
smile at her troubles, but she had the
same "everyday" attitude toward them.
Ten months ago they had been doing
well. Her husband was earning ten dollars
a week at odd jobs; two sons, twenty
and seventeen, were getting fifteen dollars
a week each as lead buffers in a coffin
works; she and her daughter kept house
and did a little sewing; and they all lived
happily together. Then one day her husband
was brought home with a smashed
foot and a leg broken in two places, as a
result of a bad fall. He had been on a
ladder, painting, when the cornice gave
way and he jumped to save himself. For
five months they kept him at the hospital
free of charge, and for four months more
he went back on crutches for treatment.
Finally they told him to come back for
an operation, but on the day after the
operation they sent him away again with
a bill of three dollars for the time he had
been there. His wife had to help him
home, and he was in bed when I called.
The doctor had said it would be better
for him to stay at the hospital, but the
superintendent decided that they could
not treat him in the ward for nothing
any longer. The wife laughed a little
grimly when she told me this.</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "I can't pay a dollar
and a half a day to that hospital. Ever
since he got hurt I've been cleaning offices.
All I can make is six dollars a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
week and I have to pay car fares out of
that."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "how about your sons?
They are making good wages."</p>

<p>"Oh, they were," she answered, "but
Harry, the oldest one, has been home
for five months. He's got gastritis, and
the doctor says it's from lead poisoning.
You know he's a lead buffer on coffins.
He don't seem to get much better."</p>

<p>"And the other boy," I said, "does he
go right on doing the same work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Charlie,&mdash;I don't know what
we'd do if he lost his job. He's been on
half time now for three months, and that
means only $7.50 a week."</p>

<p>To add to the general desolation in this
home, the flood had been in and covered
the lower floor, leaving everything
smeared with a dry, muddy paste. In the
midst of it all sat this tired woman of fifty,
who had just come home from her five
early morning hours of office scrubbing;
and she was less concerned with the bitterness
of her struggle with life than she
was with the immediate problem of how
to get her maimed old man up to the hospital
every other day for treatment.</p>

<p>This unquestioning acceptance of misfortune
does not often amount to either a
commendable cheerfulness or a deplorable
apathy. Occasionally, however, it
approaches heroism. I think the most
courageous person I met during the year
was Mrs. Herman Baum, a German
woman of forty-five or thereabouts, who,
after nine years of disappointment and
defeat, still meets the days as they come
with an unbroken spirit. She came to
America as a girl of nineteen and went
out to service. At twenty-three she married.
Her "man" turned out ugly; he
drank and was always mean to her. His
parents, who thought he had married beneath
him, took a dislike to her and
joined him in making her unhappy.
They lived along in this way for fifteen
years, during which time she bore him
seven children. One day, in his work as
a moulder, he received a slight injury,
from which blood poisoning set in. After
this his mind was affected; he became
silent, morose, and uglier than ever, giving
his wife hardly a moment, day or
night, when she was not in fear of him.
After a year or so during which he grew
steadily worse, he shot himself one night,
leaving her with the seven children, another
one coming, and no resources except
a heavily mortgaged house and $800
insurance. She had no relatives; her
father had been run over by a train, soon
after coming to America, and her only
brother had been drowned in river work
a few years before.</p>

<p>It was in August, 1906, that Mrs.
Baum's husband killed himself. In September
a baby was born, only to die before
winter. The two older children got
work and brought in ten dollars a week
between them, while Mrs. Baum took in
washing and made two or three dollars
a week. Thus things went pretty well
until June, 1907, when the second boy,
Harry, the jolly one, who "kept all their
spirits up with his jokes," was all but
killed in an elevator accident at the box
factory where he worked. When, after
four months at the hospital, he came
home with a permanent lameness, and
strict orders never again to do heavy
work, he turned to selling papers, and
is now making about $1.40 a week. After
half their small income was cut off by
this accident, Mrs. Baum tried to run a
grocery store in the front part of her
house, but she lost money at it and was
forced to give it up. When I saw her,
she was hanging somebody's washing up
in the yard. She took me into her spotless
kitchen and told me this story, not
eagerly, as if pouring out her troubles,
but only after many questions, rather reluctantly,
and with sometimes an apologetic
smile. Here, I thought, is a heroine
of modern realistic tragedy; the dramatist
would have her lost in bitter retrospect.
But she was not; she sat there
smiling a bit ruefully, and wondered
whether she must put aside her sturdy
German pride next week, and go to the
Poor Board for help.</p>

<p>Some people, especially the Irish, even
get amusement out of the number and
variety of their troubles. This is true
of the Learys, whose six years of married
life have been crowded with disasters.
To begin with, Andy, the husband, who
is a brakeman, has had nine accidents on
the road in five years, so many that his
wife could not distinguish in her memory
the one of a year ago which I had
come to inquire about. Twice he has been
near death. Once the priest performed
the last offices, but Andy pulled through
after all. Besides all these injuries, none
of them less severe than a broken bone,
he accidentally shot himself one day and
nearly died from that. "And look at him
now!" said Mrs. Leary. (Andy is a
handsome Irishman, and the picture of
health.) In addition to all this, they have
lost two children by diphtheria. Mrs.
Leary's outlook on life seems to be a
mingling of humor and superstition. She
told me, with incongruous awesomeness
in her Irish brogue, how she had heard
the "death whistle" outside the door three
times on the night that her little boy
died. And one night, when Andy had to
stay at home to take care of her, the
brakeman sent in his place was killed.
She thinks this is a "sign," and has no
doubt of Andy's ultimate fate.</p>

<p>"Oh yis," said she, "the docthers say
ye can't kill Andy,&mdash;but I know betther.
He'll be a-comin' home dead soon. Ivery
time I hear a knock at the dhoor, I thinks
to mesilf, 'There now,&mdash;it's thim, comin'
to tell me Andy's kil't.' Andy, he jokes
about it. Ony this marnin' afther I'd
been givin' him his breakfast, he starts to
go to work out the back dhoor, an' I
says, 'Andy, why don't you niver go out
the front dhoor?' 'Oh, Leary;' says he,&mdash;(that's
what he calls me&mdash;Leary)
'Leary,' says he, 'the back dhoor's good
enough for me. I'll be a-comin' by the
front dhoor soon enough, an' I won't be
walkin'."</p>

<p>With so many misfortunes the Learys
have not been able to save anything.
Four times Andy tried to join the Brotherhood
of Railroad Trainmen, but each
time after his papers were made out and
he had paid down his dollar, and the day
had come to join, he couldn't get together
the necessary nine dollars for the first
payment. With all this, there is an unfailing
humor and philosophy in the
Leary household which is irresistible.</p>

<p>Among railroad men generally there is
a certain laughing, soldier spirit. It is
part of the faith; no true "railroader" is
without it. Perhaps this spirit leans to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
recklessness with some of the younger
ones, but I believe it is just as essential
to the running of a railroad as is the
executive skill of the Hills and Harrimans.
This spirit stands by the men in
danger and makes them meet death
bravely. It stands often a harder test;
you will not break the spirit of a railroader
by cutting off his arm or giving
him a wooden leg. Out of fifteen railroad
men I visited, who had received permanent
injuries, all but four have gone
back to the road. Two of the four are
totally unable to do work of any kind.
Another has gone home for a few weeks
until he can "get used to his wooden
leg," when he will be ready for any job
the road will give him. The other, a
twenty-year-old boy who lost his right
arm at the shoulder, has learned to write
with his left hand and is studying telegraphy
as hard as he can, in order to
stick by the railroad.</p>

<p>Of the eleven who are back on the
road, nine were able to go into the same
work and pay, but two had to take lower
jobs on account of partial disability. This
meant in each case five or six dollars a
week less, but neither man complained;
he took it as part of the day's work.
What the railroader dreads is having to
quit the road altogether. A watchman's
job will be accepted with a good deal of
cheer. Notice the spirit of the one-legged
watchman at your crossing, who
is very likely a man dropped from an
active, exciting occupation at eighty dollars
a month to flagging a crossing for
forty. He is still in the game. But
try to retire a railroader on a pension
while he is able to work, and you will
break his heart.</p>

<p>To a large extent, the railroaders'
wives reflect this spirit. They are quite
resigned to the risks and dangers of the
"mister's" trade. But with the mothers,
especially those whose husbands have followed
more quiet callings, it is different.
They lead an anxious life.</p>

<p>In every dangerous occupation there is
not this sustaining common courage to
help a man endure gaily a lifelong deprivation.
A certain degree of independence
and fraternity in a group is necessary
to bring it about. Many go forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
from the steel mills maimed for life, who
have no such spirit to uphold them. I
remember one night in Homestead seeing
a boy on crutches, with one leg gone. He
was about nineteen, with blue eyes and a
shock of yellow hair falling down low on
his forehead. In his face was that desperate
look of defiance which comes with
a recent deformity. He was trying with
all his young will to be indifferent to the
stares of the crowd, while in every nerve
he felt them. All this and a weary hopelessness
were written in his sullen child-face.</p>

<p>I have shown how grief is crowded out
of the lives of working people, and how
their frequent experience of trouble gives
them an ordinary manner in speaking of
it. These things largely account for the
opinion held by many, that working people
do not feel their sorrows as keenly
as others do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I found among working
people almost no pretence of feeling
where none exists. This too, might give
rise to such an opinion. Where the
death of a husband has meant merely a
loss of income, with the attending problems
of struggle and adjustment, there
is no effort to have it appear otherwise.
Where it has aroused only a feeling of
bitterness toward the employer, this is
not concealed either. But where the death
of the bread-winner, has meant not merely
an economic problem, not merely a
legal battle, but heartache and emptiness,&mdash;that
is written, real and unmistakable,
in the faces of those left. And in the
case of sons, where there may be no
question of income, it is often possible
to tell in the first glance at the mother
whether this boy who was killed was "one
of her children," or the child of her
heart. There is an outspoken genuineness
about these people which allows
them neither to make a show of grief
where there is none, nor to hide real
suffering, even from a stranger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leary took the accidents of
"Andy" lightly. If he should happen to
be killed some day her heart would not
be broken. She spoke of the death of
her baby three months before without
feeling, mentioning the doctor's bills.
But when I asked her to tell me about
her oldest boy who died two years ago
of diphtheria, I could see at once that I
was on different ground. Her eyes filled
with tears, and there was grief and longing
in her voice as she talked about him.
You see he was only five, but they understood
each other. When she was unhappy
he knew it. He would climb up
in her lap, she said, and put his arms
around her neck and say, "Don't cry,
Mommy; I love you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns, a pretty Irish widow,
whose husband was crushed while coupling
cars, is obviously well satisfied with
the $4,000 insurance he left. She takes
boarders and is carefully saving the insurance
money for her little girl's education.
Her affections are set on this child.
She has a tender memory of her Tom as
he started off to work whistling that last
morning, but she makes no pretence to
mourn for him. She frankly admits that
her marriage was not successful enough
to make her risk it again.</p>

<p>Thus it is with Mrs. Andrews, a woman
whose husband was killed in the
mill. I found her smiling and contented
a year later. Her man had been good
and faithful while he lived, but after he
died, her brother came to live with her
and help her raise her two boys. He
earned just as much, and she was perfectly
satisfied with the situation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I knew of a six
months' bride who shot herself three
weeks after her husband was killed. And
a young German woman, whose father
had been run over by a dinky engine in
the mill, said to me in a choking voice,
"Oh, when it comes to tellin' how he
died, it breaks my heart." I have seen
mothers and fathers in middle life who
had become broken and old in a year after
the death of a son, and a few women
whom I visited eighteen months after
such a tragedy, were literally unable to
speak of it.</p>

<p>There was one wild-eyed little Scotch
woman, Mrs. MacGregor, who refused
to talk with me at all. I learned from
a neighbor that she had twice been insane.
Some years ago, when they had
lived near the railroad, a little three-year-old
girl of hers, who was playing before
the house, ran in front of a train. The
mother reached the child just in time to
touch her dress as the engine tore her
away. The mother lost her reason and
was sent to an asylum. After six or
eight months she recovered and came
home. Then, one morning two years
later, she got word to come at once to
the hospital, that her son was dying. He
was a lineman at Edgar Thompson, and
had left home to go to work as usual two
hours before. In some way,&mdash;no one
ever knew how,&mdash;he had fallen from a
ladder and broken his skull. After this
second blow the mother was again insane.</p>

<p>Then there was an old father, Macdougal,
who had had three sons. One
died of smallpox, and one was killed
in a steel mill. The third was
a railroad engineer. On the night
of March 13, 1907, he was taking
a heavy freight across a bridge at Deer
Creek, Harmarsville. The creek was
high and the pier gave way; the engine
and first cars went crashing into the
water below, carrying three men to death.
The bodies of the fireman and conductor
were recovered next day, but young Macdougal,
the engineer, was never found.
They say the old man's hair turned white
in twenty-four hours, and that he can still
be found on fair days walking along the
banks of the creek, looking for his son.
But for the most part mothers and
fathers do not lose their hold on things.
Their lives go on as before. You can
know perhaps only from a weary sadness
in the mother's eyes that the light of their
lives has gone out.</p>

<p>Death does not always mean sorrow,
and these working people, it seems to me,
feel no pressure of convention upon them
to appear sorrowful when they are not.
But where affection is strong and love is
deep, tragedies are as real with them as
with any people I have known.</p>

<p>Wherever love is found there is the
chance of grief; there is potential tragedy.
And it is in poor families, I think, that
one finds the most close and lasting affection.</p>

<p>So often, in looking up a fatal accident
case, I would come upon an intimate
and devoted family group. The case of
Will Gordon, for instance,&mdash;there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
holiday drama I shall not soon forget.
The Gordon family was a large one. Father
and mother were living, and three
working sons lived at home, besides four
younger children. Then there were two
married daughters, who lived near by
and kept in close touch with the family.
Will, the oldest son, although he was
twenty-eight, was the greatest "home
boy" of them all. He still handed every
pay envelope over to his mother, unopened,
as he had done when a child. His
working life had been varied. First he
tried the railroad, but he was slight, and
the work was too much for him. Then
for a while he did river work with one of
his younger brothers who was on a government
job. But in this he soon developed
a chronic cough, and his mother was
afraid of consumption. So finally he got
a job with the Pressed Steel Car Company,
as a pipe fitter's helper. Here the
work was lighter and seemed to agree
with him. Every two weeks he brought
home twenty-five dollars and handed it
over to his mother. Meanwhile his father,
who was fifty, had taken a job at the
Oil Refinery, firing boilers at night.</p>

<p>The boys considered this a dangerous
job for the old man, and almost every
night one of them would go with him.
Will felt most strongly about it and was
always begging his father to give it up.
On Christmas evening, 1906, the son's
arguments prevailed and his father promised
to give up the job. This made them
all especially happy on the next day,
when the two married daughters came
home with their families to celebrate
Christmas. During the day they planned
that the whole family should gather at
the oldest daughter's house for New
Year's. All the boys were to have a holiday
except Will, and he promised to get
off at noon, if he could, to eat the New
Year's dinner with them. The day came,
the family was gathered and the dinner
was ready. With much joking and
laughter and good-humored impatience,
they were waiting for Will. In the midst
of it came a boy with a scared face to say
that Will had been killed at the works.
He had been sent to repair a leak in a
pipe. The steam was left on; the pipe
burst; and he and Wilson, the pipe fitter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
were scalded to death. The father put on
his coat and hurried down to the mill to
keep them from sending his boy's body to
the morgue.</p>

<p>This family affection shows its true
nature in times of trouble. Barring what
seemed to me an unusual number of deserting
husbands, I was impressed with
the faithfulness of these people to one another
in struggle and distress. There was
Mrs. Frederick, for instance, a Swiss woman
whose husband was killed in a runaway,
while driving for a wholesale
liquor dealer. Just a week before the accident
they had bought a small house
with a $600 mortgage on it, and Mr.
Frederick said to his wife, as they were
looking over the deed: "Now we can begin
to get along, and lift up our heads,
and stop worrying."</p>

<p>Since her husband's death, even with
the $1,000 insurance, it has been hard
to keep things going and continue payments
on the house. There are four
children and only one is old enough to
work. Just in this troublous time, too,
the family burdens have increased. Mrs.
Frederick's mother has come from Switzerland,
old, feeble and without income;
and her step-daughter, who had been
away from home and independent for
years, after lying in a hospital six weeks
with a fever, has now come home, weak
and helpless, to stay until she is able to
work. Mrs. Frederick does not for a
moment question the rightfulness of these
burdens. The old grandmother and the
convalescent daughter help her around
the house; she takes in washing; the
boy's wages are good. On the whole she
is cheerful. The last thing she said to
me, as she stood in the open door, was,
"Oh, we'll get on somehow. We'll all
work together, and if we have to, we'll
starve together."</p>

<p>Another pathetic and almost humorous
instance of family loyalty is the case of a
man named Benson. I was hunting for
the wife of a brakeman, who had been
killed in the same wreck with the engineer
Macdougal of whom I have spoken.
I was told that I could learn about
her at this Benson's house. I went there
and found it a tumble-down, three-room
shanty with a small shed for a kitchen,
crowded in between brick tenements.
There was no carpet on the floor and only
a bare table and two kitchen chairs in the
living room. The man's wife was unspeakably
slovenly and, I think, half-witted.</p>

<p>When Benson came in, however, I
could see that he was different. He was
only twenty-six. His father had been a
river-man, and he himself was born in a
"shanty-boat." Owing to his mother's
early carelessness he had lost one eye.
When he grew up, he left the river and
became a teamster, and in good times he
made a living. At the time I saw him,
however, he had had only one or two
days' work a week for four months. The
hard times, and the wife, I am sure,&mdash;not
any natural shiftlessness in the man,&mdash;accounted
for the desolation of his
home. There was something fine in Benson's
face, a certain modest look of steadfastness
and pride,&mdash;the pride of the
"family protector." This protector-ship
extended even to the remote connections
by marriage of the miserable creature
who was his wife, for I found that the
brakeman's widow, whom he had taken
in and cared for after her husband's
death, was his wife's sister-in-law. Further
questioning revealed that this widow
had an old mother who had also been
dependent on the earnings of the brakeman.</p>

<p>"And what has become of the mother?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "she lives here, too. She
makes her home with me."</p>

<p>There he sat, this one-eyed teamster,
in his barren, rented, three-room castle,
and told me in a simple, serious way, as
though it were to be expected in good
families, that his wife's sister-in-law's
mother "made her home with him."</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to find a loyalty
like this in relations where one would
least expect it. I have quite lost faith
in the unkind stepmother of fairy-tale
tradition. It is a step-daughter whom
Mrs. Frederick, the Swiss woman, is caring
for in the midst of her struggle.
Three or four times I found a woman
utterly uncomforted after the loss of a
stepson. There was Conley, for instance,
a car inspector who was killed in a wreck.
A stepmother had brought him up since
he was ten years old, loving him as few
mothers love their own sons. And he
gave her back a real devotion. When his
friends would ask him why he didn't
have some fun with his money instead of
giving it all to his folks, he used to say,</p>

<p>"Well, fellows, home ain't a boarding
house."</p>

<p>It is not unusual to find young men
giving up their own prospects, to take up
the burden of the family at the sudden
death of the father. But the most memorable
instance I remember of self-sacrifice
on the part of a son was that of
James Brennan, a switchman, who was
killed on the Baltimore and Ohio in November,
1906. He, too, was only stepson
and stepbrother to the family he fathered.
Thomas Brennan, an Englishman,
had married in the seventies and
come to America, where his wife bore
him two sons and then died. Soon after,
he went back to England and married a
sister of his first wife and brought her
here to take care of his children. He
soon proved worthless as a provider.
He lived off and on with his family, but
contributed less and less to their support,
and finally left them entirely. The second
wife was not strong, and after the
birth of her last child, became an invalid.
The burden of the family thus fell
upon the shoulders of the two boys, her
nephews and stepsons. They went to
work at eleven and twelve. Arthur, the
younger, was drowned at eighteen, leaving
James, the older son, as the only support.</p>

<p>This young man never deserted his
post. During the later years his burden
increased. His stepsister made a runaway
marriage at eighteen and in two years
was deserted by her husband and came
home with a child. A feeble old grandmother
of eighty-eight came over from
England to be taken care of. His stepmother
became crippled with rheumatism
and lay in bed for two years. In June
of the year he was killed, he sent her
away to a sanatorium to get well. She
had been there for five months, had
gained twelve pounds and was doing well
when the telegram came to tell her of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
death. She came home to face the struggle
of life without him,&mdash;an aged mother
on her hands, a boy of ten, and an
in-consequent daughter with a baby,&mdash;and
she herself an invalid, suffering constantly.
One would say that the mere
problem of existence would be all absorbing
for that woman. Yet, when I found
her a year later, it was the emptiness of
her life without this son rather than the
loss of his income that was her tragedy.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of people everywhere.
This is the only final conclusion.
It is not easy therefore, to describe the
spirit in which the working people meet
trouble. They meet it in all the ways
there are. But most of those I met, had
an "everyday" attitude toward misfortune.
This seems to support the opinion
many hold, that poor people do not feel
their tragedies deeply. But I think it
is to be explained rather by the fact that
they are too busy to entertain grief, that
trouble is too common among them to
arouse exclamation, and that they make
no show of feeling where there is none.
That they know the deepest sorrow, is
obvious to one who has seen the loyalties
and lasting affections which make up so
much of their lives. I found usual in
families, a generous affection which could
rise to self-sacrifice and devotion in time
of trial; and sometimes between two
members of a family, a rare love, exclusive
and complete, so that the death of
one left the other in an empty world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tales of trouble like these are worth
listening to, chiefly as they reveal the
spirit of the people who suffered. It is
with this thought that I have told them.
But if by revealing a dreary recurrence
of the same kind of misfortune in home
after home, these stories have roused in
the reader's mind a question, perhaps a
protest, this too, is worth while. In a
later issue, by a study of these work accidents
in their happening, by a counting
of the cost to the worker and his family,
to the employer, and to society,&mdash;as at
present the cost is distributed,&mdash;we hope
to answer that question. Possibly we
shall justify that protest.</p>

<p>It requires a moment's readjustment
of our angle of vision
to see Pittsburgh as a city of
working women. To dig crude
ores, to fuse and forge them, are
not among the lighter handicrafts
at which women can readily
be employed. The old cry
of the dwarfs under the earth,
the first metal smiths, rings out
in Pittsburgh in the tap of the
miner's tools and in the shouts
of gangs of furnace-men and engine
crews in the winding recesses
of the mill.</p>

<p>Yet even in a city whose prosperity
is founded in steel and
iron and coal, there has come
into being beside the men a
group of co-laborers. If we
listen again, we hear the cry of
the dwarfs (the productive
forces of earth) not only in the
shouts of gangs of furnace-men,
but from the mobile group of
workers at the screw and bolt
works, and among the strong-armed
women who make sand-cores
in rooms planned like Alberich's
smithy in the underworld.
Listen still more closely,
and we hear the dwarf voices in
the hum of machines in a garment
factory, in the steady turn
of metal rolls in a laundry, and
even in the clip of the stogy roller's knife
in the tiny workroom of a tenement loft.
Side by side with the men, the women
workers have found a place in the industry
of the steel district in the Alleghenies.
In a district that calls pre-eminently for
strength in its workmen, and if not for
strength, for a high degree of training
and skill, there is yet place in the congregate
activity of factories and shops for
women. Individual and group necessities
have forced them out into an increasing
number of occupational ways and byways,
winding net-like over the city.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>STOGY SWEATSHOP WORKERS ON "THE HILL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>To understand fully the place that
women have taken in the industries of
Pittsburgh, we should need to know the
history of the "forks of the Ohio," from
trading post, frontier settlement, mill-town,
to the growing, complex city of
to-day. We should need to follow the
women's share in the life of the district
from the time of the woman pioneer, who
was herself a producer of goods and of
values, on through the active days of life
in a small and struggling town, and later,
into the ramifications of the industrial
city, when the days came that English
speaking labor did not suffice and a new
immigrant population was brought in.</p>

<p>We know a little of the life of the
frontier women and the work that they
did. We have hints here and there, of the
home industries of intermediate decades,
of the weaving and the stogy making<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
especially, of production for the use of
the individual home, that helped to make
the lives of women in miners' households
active and significant. There are gaps
in our recorded knowledge of the process
of change, of the forces that little by
little have been a call to the high-strung
girl of American birth, to the unconquerable
exiled Russian, to the field worker
from Austria, and to the fair-haired
Pole,&mdash;a call away from the four walls
that sheltered the industries of the home,
and toward factory and shop, toward division
of labor and specialization of work
at a machine. The census in the first half
of the nineteenth century is small help
to us. Even in later years, we can learn
from it comparatively little about the
industrial life in individual cities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> See Jour. Pol. Econ. 5: 1-25.</p></div>

<p>One fact significant of the situation in
Pittsburgh to-day is that according to the
last census, the excess of male over female
population is a trifle less than 10,000.
When the industries of the district
grew to a magnitude that drew on foreign
labor forces, it was the men of Ireland
and Germany, of Italy, Austria and Poland
who came. Later, in smaller numbers,
the women followed. They came
because their husbands and brothers
were here; not often for the purpose of
forging out a life of their own. The
women of the later immigrant races, the
Slavs and the southern Europeans, are
lagging behind. Giuseppina is still keeping
the little Italian cottage with the
thought that Pietro will return or will
have made his way more surely before
he sends for her. Life in America for
her is not a settled destiny. It is a probability
of growing importance for those
populations whose need exceeds the productive
power of the soil; but even to the
strong it is something of an experiment,
something for which women,&mdash;not industrially
adjusted,&mdash;must await the issue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>before they too follow in numbers equal
to the men.</p>

<p>In the different districts of the city,
one can trace something of the effect of
this varying feeling of permanence on
the ways of life among earlier and later
immigrants. Irish and German, in fact,
we no longer think of as immigrants.
They are as much wrought into the
fabric of the nation as those whom we
are pleased to call American. The Jewish
immigrants from Austria, Germany,
and Russia, while their coming has been
hastened by religious persecution, have
yet been part of the life of the city for so
long, that among them there is a distinct
family grouping; and there is a
normal proportion between men and women.
This is in part due to race tradition
as well as to length of settlement, but the
latter has unquestionably served to diminish
the proportion of single men, who
from this race as from others, have come
to make a place for themselves in the new
country.</p>

<p>In the congested Italian neighborhoods,
on the other hand, women are but an unimportant
factor in the industrial life of
the city. In the midst of the city itself,
there are to be sure streets of Italian
families; streets where the women still
honor the custom of life in their households.
A scattered few roll paste-smeared
tobacco leaves into tobies after the Italian
fashion, or follow with painstaking
docility the signs of the forewoman in a
garment workshop. But there are not
many of these pioneers of congregate
activity. The ties of tradition that keep
the girl to her house and early marriage
are still too strong for more than the
very few to break. There is small opportunity
in this smoke-filled city among
the hills for the Italian girl to preserve
her self-respect by staying at home, and
at the same time to increase her income
by sewing or making flowers. Flowers
of delicate tints and fine embroidered
fabrics, belong rather to the trade of
eastern cities. The garment industry
here is of a different sort from that which
has nourished and given employment to
its thousands of out-workers in New York
city. Such outwork as there is dates to
a time before the Italian women were
here in numbers, or had grouped themselves
into particular districts, and it fell
naturally into the hands of Irish and Germans
whose homes were, and still remain,
in the early settled regions in the coal
filled hills.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px;">

<div class="caption"><p>A CANNERY GIRL&mdash;BOTTLING PICKLES WITH A GROOVED STICK.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>

<p>Leave "the hill," and go down toward
the mills and to some of the outlying
sections, and you will find still fewer
women in the colonies of young Italian
laborers, advance guards from their native
towns. Some of these men are workers
on the railroads, others are day-laborers
in the mills. They bring up the
numbers of the Italian population and
contribute to the excess male population
of the entire city. Among still later immigrants,
this situation is intensified. Near
the Pressed Steel Car Works, there are
streets of low unpainted houses, each exactly
like the other, each filled with its
family of "boarders,"&mdash;single men who
club together and rent a house or hire
a bed by turns in order to make their
pay serve both for their own support and
for the help of those at home in the old
country. They are Slavs,&mdash;"Hunkies."
They are the under-workmen in mill and
mine and machine shop, who have helped
push the earlier comers a step higher and
push themselves into the subordinate jobs.
Some of the first comers have since
brought their families. Some few sisters
and friends with the desire to try new
fortune have come, too, leaving their families
behind. But the bulk of the "boarding
house" population is made up of single
men, immigrants of this race. Where
families and single women have come,
they have tended to settle in the glass-making
district, or near the manufactories
of iron and steel products that can use
quick fingers as well as strong untrained
arms.</p>

<p>The Polish women have not the conservatism
which keeps the Italian girl at
home. They have not the same standard
of close-knit family relationship. There
is a flexibility in their attitude toward
life and toward their part in it. In numbers
and in kind of work, they are an
element of industrial importance.</p>

<p>Altogether, 22,185 women wage earners
outside of agricultural, professional,
and domestic service, are employed in
Pittsburgh. These figures are based on
a careful census of the women-employing
trades made during the winter of 1907-8.
This working force is distributed in
448 factories and shops, and can be arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>

of the different trade groups as

<p>In the U. S. census of 1900, women's
work is grouped under the headings:
Agricultural Pursuits, Domestic and Personal
Service, Professional Service,
Trade and Transportation, Manufacturing
and Mechanical Pursuits. In the
accompanying table, agricultural pursuits,
and professional
service are excluded.
Under
domestic and
personal service
come only the
cleaning industries,
with 2,685
women, 12.10
per cent of the
number under
consideration.
Under
trade and transportation,
come
saleswomen and
telephone and
telegraph operators
to the number
of 8,317
(37.48 per cent).
The remainder,
11,183 women
(50.4 per cent),
are included in
manufacturing
and mechanical
pursuits.</p>

<p>It is worth
while to consider
not only the
broad groupings
and the characteristics
of the several trades, but the
women whom they have called to them,
old and young, native born, or from the
fields and towns of another country. Each
trade has its characteristic racial group,
and in some cases a secondary racial
group; and on the other hand one racial
group may be found in several trades.
When the work room is a mercantile
house, there is small need to describe it.
We know something of the work and of
its demands; we know, too, that no other
occupation seems so desirable as "clerking"
to the girl with some personal ambition
but without the training necessary
for an office position. A majority of the
girls are native-born of Irish or German
parents, but there is a scattering of bright
Jewish girls who have a characteristic
dislike for the noise of machines.</p>

<p>The mercantile houses, the stogy factories
and the
garment factories
are employers
of Jewish
girls. In all
three industries
many Americans
are to be found,
but they are in
the more desirable
positions, in
shops of the better
class, with
provision for
light and air.
These girls have
the nervous
readiness to
learn new ways,
the adaptability,
the measure of
skill, which tend
to bring them
the best work,
the better workplaces.
But
where the cheap,
hustling business
is done, the
Jewish girls predominate.
They
endure the drive
in the rarely
cleaned upper
room, where between narrow walls, faint
daylight finds its way toward the machines
and where drifting lint and ten
hours' stooping over a power-driven
needle, have their effect in time on a girl
even with the strength of rugged generations
behind her.</p>

<p>Newcomers cannot choose either workshop
or wages. With the subordination
of the industrially unadjusted, they crave
a chance to learn, whether it be by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
whirr of the needle or by team work at
cheap mold stogies to supply the workingman's
demand. In one or two of the
small box factories on "the hill," one finds
occasionally a Jewish girl. Box makers
paste the bright colored strips of paper
along the box edges. They stay the corners
by the clamp of a machine. For
heavier boxes they glue into place the
wooden supports. Such work for a Jewish
girl is exceptional, however, and in
violence to tradition. The three industries
mentioned above make up her circle
of possible choices.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>TOBACCO STRIPPERS IN A HILL SWEATSHOP. WORKERS OF THE LOWEST INDUSTRIAL GRADE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Yet each industry, notably stogy
making and the needle trades, has drawn
upon a second racial element in response
to a specific industrial demand. When
the garment makers, spurred to production
by the presence of an army of laborers
in mills and mines, began to increase
and cheapen their output, they
gave the jeans and railroad jumpers to
Irish and German women who would
make them at home. The sweating system,
as old and older than the ready-made
trade, has adapted itself to the city,
and has taken a form scarcely recognizable
to one familiar with the contract
shops on New York's East Side. There
is no contract system here. Outwork entrenched
itself in individual homes before
Italians and immigrant Russians
had settled into districts, and the only
available out-workers were the wives of
Irish and German workingmen in Carrick
and Lower St. Clair. Even to-day,
it takes a rambling journey along muddy
foot-paths, across brooks and fields and
along the edges of the barren hills to
bring you to the sweated district. The
workroom here is not a crowded tenement,
but a small wooden house with
six machines someway placed in the living
room, and there is occupation for the
whole family, from father to baby. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
family has to pay the driver a percentage
on every dozen garments that he brings,
according to the distance from town. As
the driver knows the people and often
gives them the chance to work, his position
is in some respects that of a middleman.
The workers are obliged to meet
his terms or to turn to some other means
of livelihood. A seemingly inaccessible
hill country within city limits, wooden
shacks swarming with chickens and children,
a whirr of machines audible from
the field below,&mdash;these contradictions
characterize the sweating system of Pittsburgh.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>STOGY WORKERS TRANSPLANTED TO AMERICA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We have seen that Jewish and American
girls are in the garment factories,
while Irish and German women, the hill-dwelling
wives of the miners, hold the
subordinate place in the trade. In the
stogy industry, the Polish women, some
of them married and others immigrant
girls, have the inferior and unpleasant
work. The least desirable occupation
for women in stogy factories is tobacco
stripping, pulling the stems out of the
moist leaves and weighing and tying
them in pounds for the rollers. In tenement
shops, one may find the strippers in
a cellar, their backs against a damp wall,
working by the light of a flaring gas
jet. In a large factory, one will see them
sitting in their low stalls, row behind
row, stemming and weighing and throwing
the waste to one side. "They would
work all night," one foreman said, "if
I would give them the chance. We never
have any trouble with them; we can't
give them enough work to do." They
were married women in this case; but
the rule holds good and there is seldom
trouble with the Polish hands in a stogy
factory. They are there too much on
sufferance for grievances to be worth
their while. They have entrenched themselves
in the stripping rooms and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
found now and then at a bunching machine
or rolling stogies at the suction
table, but this more skilled work is still
largely in the hands of American and
Jewish girls.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 677px;">

<div class="caption"><p>A LAUNDRY WORKER AT A BODY IRONING MACHINE. ONE OF THE SKILLED HANDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Polish women have pushed their
way into a wider circle of industries than
have the Jewish girls. They are limited
by lack of training and by trade indifference,
as well as by the stolid physical
poise that cannot be speeded at the high
pressure to which an American girl will
respond. They have not an industrial
standard that would tend to react progressively
upon the character of their
work and the arrangement of the workrooms.
They accept factory positions
that girls of other races regard as socially
inferior. They consent to do the
rough and unpleasant work, the work
that leads and can lead to nothing except
coarsening of fiber and a final break in
strength. They change from one place
to another with an irresponsibility, an independence,
born perhaps of long-slumbering
memories of revolution in their
own land.</p>

<p>In canneries and cracker factories, we
find Polish girls who are lighter-handed,
fairer, more delicately built than those
of the metal trades and the glass houses.
These girls have rapid work to do. They
have the nervous energy to pack or to
fill cans at high speed. They stand beside
the travelling conveyor which carries
cans of beans, and slip a bit of pork into
each can as it passes. Without turning
their heads or changing their position,
working with high concentration
and intensity, they can keep pace
with the chains. While they do much
of the mechanical work, the hulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
and stemming of berries, the preparing
of fruit, the filling and labeling
of cans, they are found too among the
bottling girls on whom responsibility
for the appearance of the finished product
largely rests. These latter place
each pickle or piece of preserved fruit
after the model design taught them in the
beginning. They use a grooved stick
to slip the pickles into place, and are
obliged to be accurate as well as quick,
for they work under inspection on a
piece basis. A piece of onion misplaced
in a bottle of mixed pickles is held sufficient
ground for requiring the bottler
to do the work over at the expense of
her own time. The odor of vinegar and
of preserves, an odor that seems to have
saturated the air in nearby streets, has
made the cannery unpopular among
Americans who have acquired fastidiousness
in the choice of a trade.</p>

<p>It is possible that between the Polish
women in this latter industrial group and
those in the metal trades, there is the difference
between the child of the city and
the child whose life and the life of whose
parents has been near the earth. At any
rate, there is the general difference between
the small, slight, fair-haired girl,
and the rough-skinned stolid women,
whom even a piece-rate scarcely avails
to keep up to the pace of the machine.
These latter are the women who with
knee and hand and metal-centered glove,
open the sheets of tin still warm from the
furnaces of the sheet and tin plate mill;
these are the women who screw nuts
on bolts by a fish-oil process, and
these are the women who carry trays of
sand-cores in the foundries where they
have displaced men. They are the packers
in glass factories, the riveters and
foot-press operators in lamp works.
They have a hundred miscellaneous
things to do, no one of which is a trade,
or can be a trade so long as a shifting
group of women, women with muscular
strength and the readiness to do disagreeable
things, is at hand for the odd jobs
about a factory. They learn to operate
one machine, but they are not among the
hands who know the ways of the shop,
and work up to better occupations. Either
through the barrier of language, or
in part through their own indifference,
they are used for the least desirable work
in those occupations which in a measure
they have made their own.</p>

<p>Polish girls of both types are to be
found in laundries, but in most cases
they are employed in the mangle room
only. Their work is to feed in sheets
under the metal rolls, to shake them out
before feeding, or to receive and fold
them at the other end while steam rises
from the hot metal and from the huge
washing cylinders below.</p>

<p>There remain unaccounted for the
workers in the candy industry, in many
of the miscellaneous trades, in telephone
and telegraph offices, in the wholesale
millinery houses, and in press rooms
and bookbinderies. Here there is variation
as the individual and the location
rather than as the trade group. In large
measure, the employes are of American
birth. Telephone and telegraph work
share with mercantile houses the advantage
of social esteem, and by reason of
this, claim the American girl. The
same is true of the millinery workroom,
in spite of its irregular hours and short
seasons. Perhaps a reflected "odor of
sanctity," an association by proxy with
clerical work, has made press rooms and
binderies favored above more obviously
manufacturing pursuits. Perhaps, too,
the location of the binderies in the business
section of the city has given them a
force of American employes, for the Polish
girl, like her Jewish co-worker, is
limited in her imaginings to factories
and shops within the few streets that
make up the sum of her experience. Yet
to an extent press rooms and binderies
employ girls of foreign birth, and in the
cork factory, many of the sorters are
Poles. For some reason, the candy trade
is largely in the hands of Americans,
and is in high esteem among women
workers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></p>

<p>Surveying the city, then, we see
American and German girls holding the
positions for which a few months' training
is needed, a knowledge of English,
or of reading and writing. We see them
yielding the inferior and unpleasant work
to newcomers from Poland and Russia
and we see these same newcomers, sometimes
by sheer physical strength, sometimes
by personal indifference and a low
standard, competing on the basis of lower
wages with men. Work that otherwise
would never have been given to girls
to do has come into the hands of Polish
women. Workrooms that would not long
be tolerated by Americans,&mdash;they have
been regarded with indifference, perhaps
because of inability to share the sensations
of a foreigner. The place of the
Polish women, scrubbing floors and sorting
onions in a cannery, packing crackers,
stripping tobacco for the stogy makers,
or making sand-cores in a machine
shop,&mdash;this place is lowest industrially
among the women workers of Pittsburgh.
It is the place of the woman
who is fighting her way but has not yet
thought whither she is going. A determination
to work and to earn is
uppermost. Marriage is not suffered to
act as a hindrance. There is notable
absence of standard as to conditions of
work and rate of wages. With light
foothold here and there, the Italian girl
scarcely figures, but within a limited
circle of industries immigrant Jewesses
hold positions beside girls of native birth.</p>

<p>From trading post and frontier settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
from ambitious mill-town, Pittsburgh
has come to be a city whose workrooms
number a force of over 22,000
women. From home industry and from
household work, the younger generation
of girls has entered the field of collective
service. From doing the whole of a
thing and from knowing the user, the
younger generation has gradually found
its work more and more minutely subdivided;
the individual worker makes
not even a whole hinge but a tenth part
of it, and knows neither the use nor the
destination of the finished product. She
does not know the relation of her fraction
of the work to the other fractions
or to the interwoven threads of industry
that make up the plant. These younger
women have pushed past the traditional
activities of cleaning and cooking and
sewing; even the congregate form of
these industries engages but a few of
them. They have not only gone into
press rooms and binderies, into cork factories,
and into workrooms where candies
are made and where fruit is preserved,
but they help finish the glass
tumblers that the men in the next room
blow, they make the cores for the foundry-men,
and they are among the shapers
of metal for lamps
and for hinges and
bolts and screws.
In a city that is preeminent
for the making
of steel and iron
and the products of
steel and iron, women
have taken to-day
a place in industries
that seemed wholly in the province
of men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 681px;">
<img src="images/fig094.jpg" width="681" height="490" alt="" />
<div class="caption"></div>
</div>

<p>It means readjusting our angle of
vision, but it is not a difficult readjustment,
to see Pittsburgh as a city of working
women. From river to river, women
have their share in its industrial
life. More than a theory, more than
a reform movement, is needed to turn
back a tide that is twenty-two thousand
strong, that has its roots deep in commercial
methods and commercial success.
Change in industrial method, when such
change makes for cheapness or for efficiency
or for the utilization of a hitherto
only partially utilized labor force, cannot
be stayed by any theory as to its
inappropriateness. Industrial forces, in
that they are the forces of production,
are still dominant in America. There is
nothing in the Pittsburgh situation that
looks toward undoing the change that
has come about in the industrial position
of women; but we can find out more
exactly in this steel city how the work of
women is related to that of men, how far
women have reached the point of being
self-supporting and independent, and
what the social effect of labor under
these new conditions seems to be.
Through change in
some of these conditions,
much that
seems evil in the nature
of women's work
may be undone and
the real value of it
released as a permanent
and useful factor
in industrial life.</p>

<p>Above one of the busiest corners in
Pittsburgh, an immense advertisement
in Croatian solicits patronage for an
American bank. In the railroad stations
and on the principal thoroughfares you
can see groups of people who bear unmistakably
the Slavic physiognomy. But
the Slav is reserved; even the Southern
Slav lacks the unrestrained animation so
characteristic of the Italian. He is slow
in making an impress on the imagination
of the community. Though the Slavs
are one of the three largest racial elements
that immigration is adding to our
population, though in the Pittsburgh district
they constitute over one-half of the
workers in the steel mills, yet in spite of
their large numbers and their importance
as an industrial and business
factor, there is, I believe, little actual
understanding and appreciation of them
on the part of Americans. The bosses
know them chiefly as sturdy, patient, and
submissive workmen; their American
fellow-workmen hate and despise them
largely because of this patience and submissiveness
to the bosses and their willingness
at the outset to work at any
wages and under any conditions; the
public at large knows the Slavs by their
most obtrusive and objectionable traits,&mdash;especially
by the newspaper stories of
their rows and fights when they get
drunk on payday or when celebrating a
wedding or a christening. Few people
realize that the "Hunkie" in spite of his
proclaimed "stolidity" is capable of all
the finer emotions,&mdash;that his aspirations
are the same in character, though as yet
not so ambitious nor so definitely formulated
as those of his neighbor Americans.</p>

<p>It is my design in this article to present
the immigrant Slavs as they have
not yet been generally seen,&mdash;as human
beings even if crude, with some virtues
along with their widely recognized vices,&mdash;to
present something of their spirit,
their character, their attitude toward
America, and the effect on them of the
conditions under which as in Pittsburgh
and the neighboring mill towns they live
and work. For this design I feel I have
at least the qualification of knowledge;
in preparation for this immediate task
I visited some two hundred families;
moreover, I am a Slav by birth, and all
my life I have lived and worked among
the Slavic people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/fig103.jpg" width="307" height="681" alt="" />
<div class="caption"></div>
</div>

<p>The natural question rising in one's
mind is, Why did these great hordes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
come to America and to Pittsburgh? Let
me answer in terms of men. The main
cause is of course economic. On the
one side there is the old world surplus
of labor accompanied by low wages, the
barrenness of the land which every year
becomes more insufficient to support
growing populations, and economic disasters
affecting sometimes individuals
and sometimes whole communities; on
the other side, the stories of the wealth
of some bolder pioneers and of the great
opportunities in this country, confirmed
and exaggerated by the crafty agents of
transportation companies. An illustration
of this economic impetus is the
simple story of Grigory Leshkoff. Grigory
comes from a Russian peasant
family in which there were seven sons
and twenty poor acres of land. "What
were we to do at home?" Grigory demanded
of me with a shrug. "Just look
at one another,&mdash;hey?" One by one
these sons left the crowded farm and
sought work in the few mines and factories
located near them. Grigory's
younger brother was the first from the
village to seek America, coming here in
1902. But soon others followed him,
"and now," said Grigory, "there are in
Homestead at least fifty young men from
our village."</p>

<p>Grigory, by the way, is a veteran of
the Japanese war, having come to America
immediately after its close. But he
has little to say about this one of the
great conflicts of modern times; in fact,
he looks upon his experience upon battle
fields as quite commonplace compared
with his experience in the steel mills.
From the first he emerged without a
scratch; in the second he lost a leg.
When I saw him he was deeply concerned
with what a strong man of twenty-seven
with only one leg was going to
do with his future,&mdash;and the simple peasant
was not seeing much hope ahead.</p>

<p>Grigory came from Chernigov. From
this government, and from Minsk and
Grodno, where the soil is exhausted and
where the shares of the villagers in the
communes grow less with each redistribution
of the land, the Russians are setting
out in increasing numbers. Not
altogether dissimilar causes operate in
certain districts of Austria-Hungary.
Pribich used to be one of the richest
wine growing regions in Croatia, but
some fifteen years ago the vines were
devastated by a blight, necessitating replanting
with American stock. In this
way hundreds of once prosperous farmers
were reduced to poverty. Many of
them came to the United States in the
hope of earning enough money to pay
for the necessary replanting of their
vineyards. Lazo Milutich, who gave me
this information, was himself one of
those affected by the calamity. He came
to Allegheny about twelve years ago,
where he tried different jobs, and after
two years wandering landed at Wilmerding.
Here he has worked for the last
ten years in the same foundry.</p>

<p>Other causes than economic pressure
have of course played their part in this
great migration. Political oppression
is one. I have met a number of political
refugees among the older Slavs,
many now persons of importance. And
another is the blandishment and trickery
of the steamship agent. John Godus, a
Slovak living in Braddock, is one of a
group of twelve young men brought
here in 1901, by the last influence. To
their village came a man dressed as a
common workingman. We can imagine
him in high boots, wearing an embroidered
shirt, and smoking a long-stemmed
pipe. He was a steamship agent, thus
disguised to escape the attention of the
gendarmerie. He quietly found out
what young men were at the age when
one has to present himself for conscription
in the army,&mdash;for such youths
he had discovered, were the easiest induced
to be customers; secretly argued
with them that it would be foolishness
to give three of their best years to the
army, where they would be slapped,
kicked and cursed; and in the end sold
them all tickets.</p>

<p>PITTSBURGH TYPES.</p>

<p>LAD FROM HERZEGOVINA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps but natural that Pittsburghers
should believe that the fame of
their industries should draw these Slavs
straight from their villages to Pittsburgh.
Yet this is rarely true,&mdash;true
only in exceptional cases, such as that of
Joseph Sabata, a Bohemian. He was an
iron-worker at home and was employed
in a large rolling mill in Moravia. Their
machinery was imported mostly from
the United States and he, noticing the
name of an Allegheny firm on some
of the pieces, thought that in that city
he could learn more about his business;
and so five years ago decided to come
over. After being landed at Ellis Island,
he discovered while in line waiting to
be questioned, that everybody was asked
to show an address. Such an address
he did not have, but he does have quick
wits; he hastily scribbled on a piece of
paper "Allegheny," and the name of a
cousin still in the old country who had
probably never even heard the name of
that city. He was readily admitted,
went straight to Allegheny, and when I
saw him was earning $2.75 a day in a
machine shop.</p>

<p>In another case I met with, the coming
straight to Pittsburgh was quite accidental.
V&aacute;clav M&aacute;lek, a Bohemian,
who came here with his parents eighteen
years ago when a lad of sixteen, had intended
to settle with the rest of the
family on a farm in Wisconsin. But
on the way across the ocean they became
acquainted with another Bohemian family,
bound for Pittsburgh, who had been
robbed of their money, and to these people
M&aacute;lek's father loaned eighty dollars.
In order not to lose the money they decided
to keep near their debtors and they
too came to Pittsburgh. John even to
this day is sorry they didn't go on a
farm,&mdash;and for a double reason: first, he
has a natural preference for farm labor
which is never to be gratified; second,
in the course of his work for an Allegheny
company, an accident crippled him
for life.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases the Slavs
in Pittsburgh had not the slightest intention
of settling there when they first
came to America. Usually their location
there has been preceded by a period
of a year or two or even longer during
which they have wandered hither and
thither, from one factory to another,
from town to town, looking for the right
place to settle.</p>

<p>Large numbers of the Slovaks come
to Pittsburgh by way of the anthracite
fields. At the time of the strike,&mdash;and
for several years before when conditions
were bad in hard coal mining, half-time,
and the like of that, the Slavic mineworkers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
drifted west,&mdash;across the state
to the steel mill district.</p>

<p>The experience of a Ruthenian named
Koval is typical of a great number
of men. He came to America three
years ago, and was sent by an immigrant
home in New York to work in
the forests of West Virginia as a woodcutter.
The wages there were only
fifty cents a day, and in other ways the
conditions were so bad that he and
three other men ran away. They wandered
through the woods until they
came to a little settlement with a saw
mill, where they were offered work and
stayed for about two months, earning
$1.50 a day. Then a surveyor
came to the village, who spoke Polish,
and told them that in Allegheny they
could earn a good deal more money
than in the woods, so to Allegheny
they decided to go. There they obtained
work as laborers in the locomotive
works at $1.50 for a day of ten hours.</p>

<p>Such a wanderer also, was Smulkstis,
a Lithuanian who started life as a
messenger boy in the telegraph service
in St. Petersburg. He came to a friend
in Wilmerding four years ago, but, unable
to get the kind of work he wanted,
he sought out another friend in Worcester,
Mass., where he got a job in a
woolen mill. The next spring found
him back in Pittsburgh as a machine
operator in an electrical plant. To-day,&mdash;he
is still only twenty-two,&mdash;he
is a crane man in the Homestead steel
mills. Similarly, a Croatian who was
spending the winter in Duquesne, was
a type of the migratory railroad laborer,
who drifts from one contractor's
gang to another. He had been all over
Indiana, Ohio and the Middle West and
had taken his wife and children with
him. They made shift in cars and
shanties and construction camps of all
sorts.</p>

<p>One fact that was continually striking
me in Pittsburgh was the number
of ordinary men, earning low wages,
who seem to be fitting themselves permanently
to their new environment.
John Gerza, an engine cleaner in the
Fort Wayne yards, and his family impressed
me as having, in their five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
years in this country, adapted themselves
very readily to the atmosphere
and to the life of Pittsburgh. There
are no regrets nor looking backward,
nothing to draw him away from the
present life. The explanation for this
adaptation is the explanation in so
many other cases that it is worth setting
down. Gerza lived in a Moravian
village where till sixteen years ago
there had been no impulse to move
away from the soil. The villagers were
rooted to their ancient homes; they
thought only of the land, and they
tilled it in the same old, primitive manner
of their forefathers. Then a railroad
was built through the country,
and factories sprang up. These drew
agricultural laborers from the villages,
and thereby unsettled the population;
unsettled the old conditions of life, and
practically destroyed that love for, that
almost physical kinship with, the soil
and the old home which I found so
strong among the Slavs in general.
Gerza's wife used to work in a sugar
factory at home; he himself used to be
a brakeman on a freight train. With
them it was not the severe and wrenching
change from farm to factory, with
the involved breaking away from loved
surroundings; it was the comparatively
simple change from one industrial pursuit
to a comparatively similar industrial
pursuit.</p>

<p>Palinski, a Russian Pole of forty-five
who has been in America eighteen
years, is another example of that really
considerable class of ordinary, low-paid
workmen who have made a small success,&mdash;if
owning a home and having a
happy family and being content is
termed success. The highest pay Palinski
has ever received was $1.65 a
day, and yet, though he has five children,
he managed five years ago to buy
in conjunction with his brother the
house in which they live. They paid
$1,600 for the property, and now Jones
and Laughlin want to buy it and Palinski
expects to sell for at least $3,000. The
oldest child, a girl of fifteen, is kept in
public school, and the three other children
of school age are sent to the parochial
school where tuition must be paid.
The house is strikingly clean and well
arranged. Palinski seems to be well
satisfied with himself, his family and
his work.</p>

<p>It was a marvel to me how a man
with Palinski's wages could own such
a pleasant home, raise so large a family
of children, educate them, and keep
them well-dressed and healthy. The
explanation lies in a great measure
outside Palinski. He is a good man,
but, as in so many of the cases where
the Slavs have wrought pleasant homes
out of little wages, the credit is largely
due to the wife. Mrs. Palinski
must have been a wonderful manager;
even to the casual eye, she was neat,
bright and energetic. In estimating
the worth to America of this pair, one
must not consider alone the hardworking
husband and the able wife; one
must consider their contribution of
healthy, educated children.</p>

<p>These men are fixtures; in a generation
or two their children and children's
children are likely to be an indistinguishable
part of that conglomerate
product, the American citizen. In
contrast to these men are the great
numbers who are not content, who are
not fixtures,&mdash;whose great dream it is
some day to get back to their native
village, live out their years there and,
what is no small consideration with
many, be laid at rest in friendly soil.
Why these men, even though successful
here, have this yearning and take
this action, presents a rather tough
question to most persons. That question,
I think, I can best answer by reciting
the case of Mike Hudak.</p>

<p>Hudak is a Slovak who came to this
country seventeen years ago when a
youth of nineteen. He is a fine type of
a man in every way; physically he
could almost be classed as a giant, for
he stands six feet two, is deep of chest
and broad of shoulders. He works in the
Pennsylvania repair shops at Oliver,
earning eighty dollars a month, which
is good pay for a Slav when one considers
that the work is regular and not
dangerous. He seems to be quite a figure
in his neighborhood, for when I walked
home with him one day he was addressed
from all sides in tones that showed
liking and respect. He dresses neatly
and has a fluent command of English.
If there is any type of immigrant that
we need above all others it struck me
that Mike Hudak is that type.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Drawn by Joseph Stella.</i></p>

<p>PITTSBURGH TYPES.</p>

<p>OLD WORLDS IN NEW.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I first discovered his yearning by asking
him why he was not a citizen. "Why
should I forswear myself," said he.</p>

<p>I did not understand and asked for
an explanation. "As I am going back
to my old country, it would not be right
to give up my allegiance there and make
myself a citizen here." I pressed him
for his reasons for going back, and he
gave them to me,&mdash;reasons that fit thousands
and thousands of cases. With him
that preliminary process of being separated
from the soil had not taken place,
as with John Gerza. He was a farmer
by age-old instinct; his love for the land
was a part of his being, was a yearning
which would leave him only with death.
Now, since over here he had been
plunged straight into industry, the only
land he had ever known in a way to
become attached to it was the land in
which he was born, and when the time
came when he was able to gratify his
longing for land his thoughts went only
to the land in his old country. So,
though socially as well off as he would
be there, and economically much better
off, he was going back. Undoubtedly
he, too, would be a fixture in America
could he have gone on a farm immediately
upon his arrival here,&mdash;for then
his instinctive land-love would have been
weaned from the old country and fixed
upon America. Few Slavs who settle
upon the land ever change back to
Europe.</p>

<p>The Slavs are strong, willing workers,
and are generally considered by the steel
mill officials the best laborers they get,&mdash;but
now and then there is a man who
is too slow for America. One of these
was John Kroupa, a Bohemian who has
been here twenty-two years. Faithful,
strong, willing, it wasn't in him to keep
up the race. He was in his earlier years
here employed in a steel mill, but he was
dropped. As he frankly said to me,
"You have to be pretty quick in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
mills, and it isn't a job for a man like
me." Later he got a job as watchman
on a Pennsylvania Railroad crossing in
Woods Run, and there he worked for
sixteen years, his wages forty dollars a
month for a twelve hour day and a seven
day week. (In the last two years, forty-four
dollars.) All this while he hoped
for promotion, but it did not come and
this non-recognition rankled within him.
"Other men, who were all sore from sitting
down so much, were promoted,"
exclaimed he, "but I, who was always
hustling, was never thought of, and I can
tell you it wasn't an easy job to watch
that no accident happened, as more than
300 trains passed that way every day and
very often at full speed, disregarding the
city ordinances,&mdash;thirty or forty miles an
hour." Three years ago the crossing was
abolished, the tracks having been elevated.
The superintendent came to him at
that time. "Well, John, I am sorry for
you; going to lose your happy home.
But you'll get another just as good."
This was too much for John; his long
smoldering disappointment burst out.
"Go to hell!" said he, "A happy home!
I could just as well have been in the penitentiary
over there; I would have been
much better off, without the responsibility
and worry I have here. During
sixteen years I didn't have a single day
off. Sundays and weekdays both I have
to be here for twelve hours. Do you
call that a happy home?"</p>

<p>He refused the new-old job. He now
keeps a little store in Woods Run,
which he has established out of his savings
and with the help of his children,&mdash;a
store which might have served
Dickens for one of his grotesque backgrounds,
for here are on sale hardware,
candy, crackers, bacon, eggs, molasses.
Kroupa cannot be classed as a failure,
for he has managed to buy a home and
raise and educate a good sized family,
but he has not made the success that his
qualities of constancy, honesty and sobriety
should have won him. His inborn
slowness was too great a handicap.</p>

<p>Among the Slavs the Slovaks strike
me as the most ambitious and pushing.
This is all the more surprising when one
remembers that the conditions out of
which they come are as bad as the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
surrounding any of the Slavs,
and worse than most. The Slovaks
when they come here, are poor, illiterate,
have no training, are inured to oppression;
yet they have pluck, perseverance,
enterprise and courage. From
their ranks are recruited many of the
foremen in the mills and an ever increasing
number of merchants. In the Woods
Run district, with which I happen to be
best acquainted,&mdash;a low-lying mill neighborhood
along the Ohio in Allegheny
City, probably one-half of the stores and
saloons are in the hands of Slovaks, or
their close neighbors, the Hungarian
Rusnaks. They were all common laborers
at one time. Most of the stores are
well kept and, in general, prosperous-looking,
and among their customers are
not only Slavs, but Americans as well.</p>

<p>A type of this class of men, the men
who succeed, is John Mlinek. When I
first saw him I had not the least thought
that he was a Slav, so well-dressed and
thoroughly Americanized did he seem,
and such good English did he speak. He
came to America thirteen years ago when
only fifteen years old. He worked successively
as a breaker-boy and driver in
the mines at Mahanoy City, then in the
iron-works at Elizabeth, New Jersey,
then as a riveter in the Pressed Steel Car
Company at Allegheny, where he was
soon making three to four dollars a day.
As he neither drank nor indulged in any
other form of dissipation he saved considerable
money. In 1905, he married a
Slovak girl born and brought up in this
country who for several years before
her marriage, had clerked in a store
where they had foreign customers. She
is a little more refined than the average
English-speaking girl of the working
class, and holds a high position in her
own circle. She is quite ambitious and
induced her husband to start a store in
Woods Run. He sells cigars and candy
and is doing very well; from what I
could gather, they already must have
several thousand dollars saved. These
young people seem to be much liked in
the community; they are prominent both
in their social circle and in their church,
and Mlinek is an influential man among
the Slovak societies, though he does not
at all push himself to the front. Mlinek,
I would say, is at the beginning of a
considerable success; his prospects and
his personality favor his achieving it;
only some untoward set of circumstances
can keep him down.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs back, in the case of
Hudak, I spoke of the powerful call
their native bit of earth makes upon so
many of the immigrants. But frequently
when men go back, intending to stay,
in response to this call, the old country
is not strong enough to hold them. Such
was the case with this same John
Mlinek. It was his ambition to be a
well-to-do farmer in Hungary in a few
years, and recently he and his wife made
a preliminary visit to his old home and
bought a farm. They remained a few
weeks,&mdash;but those few weeks were quite
enough. He came back quite cured.
"Every little clerk in the village looked
down on me, because I didn't speak the
official language, Magyar," Mlinek said
to me. "He was an official while I was
just a peasant. He didn't earn a quarter
of what I do, yet I had to bow to him.
That made me sore. In America I'm a
free man. Besides, I've got a better
chance to do well than in the old country.
Yes, America is good enough for
me."</p>

<p>Mike Mamaj is another successful
man; he also returned to Hungary, expecting
to live there, and he also turned
his back on his native country and came
again to America, this time to stay. He
has learned to speak, read and write
English, and he is full of energy, though
rather rude and domineering in his manner.
During the early part of his career
in America (he came here twenty
years ago) he had a hard time, but for
the last seven years he has been a foreman
in the car shops at Woods Run. He
has seventy men working under him, and
part of the time he has earned $100 a
month. He owns the house in which he
lives, worth about $2,500, has property in
the old country to the value of $1,500,
and has money in the bank.</p>

<p>Mamaj is proud of his success, of his
home, of his children. So proud that, on
the occasion of our first meeting, though
the bed-time hour of nine had come, he
dragged me off to show me the evidence
of what he had done in America.</p>

<p>PITTSBURGH TYPES.</p>

<p>IMMIGRANT OUT OF WORK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>First I had to inspect his home, which
was neat and well-furnished. Then he
ordered his children (three daughters,
eight, ten and thirteen) who were going
to bed, to dress and recite their lessons
for the stranger. While the girls rather
sleepily displayed some of their English
learning, Mamaj stood by, hands in his
pockets, and nodded proudly.</p>

<p>A quality that I have noted again and
again among the Slavs is their readiness
to help their countrymen,&mdash;already instanced
by the case of M&aacute;lek's father
loaning money to a robbed fellow immigrant.
Sometimes this generosity shows
itself amid the most adverse circumstances,
as it did with Koval. Koval (the
same man that I mentioned as having
wandered about before settling in Pittsburgh)
has himself had enough misfortune
during his three years in America
to drive all unselfish feeling for others
out of a man's heart. Two years ago he
sent for his family and his younger
brother. Immediately upon their arrival
his three children and his brother fell
sick with typhoid fever. They were no
sooner well than Koval himself went
down with the fever. This illness, since
it drained their resources, forced them to
fill their home with boarders,&mdash;which was
a hardship on the slight wife, all the more
keenly felt because keeping boarders had
been no part of their original plan. Then
all three of the children were taken ill
with the croup. The usual price for a
doctor's call is one dollar, but the doctor
charged three dollars each visit inasmuch
as he had three patients; Koval protested,
but had to pay. Two of the children
died, and Koval, by this time financially
exhausted, had to go in debt to the undertaker
for the funerals. And then amid
these last disasters came the financial
crash, with its misery of unemployment.</p>

<p>Certainly enough to sour the milk of
human kindness in any man. But the
penniless Koval did not drive out his
penniless boarders, now only a burden.
Instead, he gave them a sleeping place,
divided with them the food he could get
on credit from the grocery, for since he
was a steady man and a householder
Koval still had some credit; and for the
rest of the food, he and his boarders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
would go and stand in the bread line,
which had been established in Woods
Run. Not only did Koval not throw out
the penniless boarders, who already encumbered
him, but he took in seven additional
people who were in distress. Two
of these latter were young men from his
native village who had landed in Pittsburgh
in the midst of the depression; two
were Russians who had been found wandering
through the streets, nearly frozen,
by a policeman, who brought them to
Koval; the others were a countryman,
his wife and child of six, and to accommodate
these Koval had to give up his
own bed. During the period of my acquaintance
with him Koval was supporting
twelve boarders, only one of whom
was paying him a cent.</p>

<p>What he was doing seemed quite the
natural thing to Koval; he hardly
seemed conscious of his generosity.
"Why do you keep all these people?"
I asked him. "Why, what else could
I do?" he returned. "They have no
work and no other place to go. I cannot
throw a man into the street. They
will go themselves when they can."</p>

<p>Frequently circumstances throw the
burden of the home upon the child. In
looking into an accident case I called
at a home in Saw Mill alley,&mdash;a cheerless,
dingy neighborhood that is flooded
every year by the high water. I
was received in the kitchen by a slight
Polish girl of fifteen, and soon discovered
that she was the real head of the
home. Annie had just finished the
wash, and at such a time even the best
of houses are apt to be in disorder,
but here everything was neat and
clean. She told me her story willingly
enough. Her father, who had been a
laborer in one of the mills, had been
killed by an engine while working in
the yard at night. Her mother had
remarried, and soon had herself been
killed by the explosion of a kerosene
lamp. Annie was now keeping house
for a brother and her stepfather. As
the seventeen-year-old brother was
rather shy, and as the stepfather was
a night-watchman, naturally a man of
no authority and allowed by his work
little opportunity to exercise it even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
had he possessed it, the main control
of the household has passed into
Annie's hands. That authority she
was using well, as was shown not only
by the tidiness of the house, but by
the fact that it is chiefly through her
influence that her brother is attending
night school. She has energy, determination
and character. She reads
and writes both English and Polish.
She said she liked to read books, history
especially, but that she hadn't the
time.</p>

<p>Annie's stepfather is soon to marry
a widow, but this further complication
of her already complicated family relations
does not seem to trouble her
in the least. In fact she was quite enthusiastic
over her future stepmother.
"She came to see me the other day,"
she said, "and she was awful nice. Oh,
she's fine all right, and she's rich!"</p>

<p>"Rich? How rich?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's got a lot o' money! It's
a benefit she got from a society when
her first man died. She's got $1,200!"</p>

<p>One deplorable trait I frequently
met with among the Slavs was contempt
for American law. The existence
of this trait is largely due to the
teaching of experience,&mdash;and experience
of one particular sort. The story
of Vilchinsky, a Ruthenian boarding-boss,
is such a common one, it illustrates
so well a wide-spread condition
in the administration of law by the
petty aldermen's courts of the Pennsylvania
industrial districts, that it is
worth repeating for the sake of its general
significance. October 14, 1907,
one of the boarders was celebrating his
patron saint's day. This meant a lot
of drinking by all, and during the festivities
they got more or less under the
influence of liquor, but they were in
their own home, there was no public
disturbance, and toward midnight they
all went to bed. About two o'clock
in the morning, however, when they
were all asleep, policemen came to the
house, wakened everybody and loaded
them into patrol wagons and buggies
and took them to a police station. The
boarding-boss, four girls and three men
were all taken before the magistrate,
charged with disorderly conduct.
Without any regular hearing,&mdash;none of
them could speak English and there
was no interpreter,&mdash;the squire asked for
twenty dollars apiece for the boarders
and fifty dollars for the boarding-boss.
All but two girls paid the fine immediately,
and these two were then sentenced to
the county jail. During the following
day, their friends succeeded in collecting
enough money to pay their fines
and the $1.50 extra for board in the
jail.</p>

<p>Abuses such as this are generated
by the fact that aldermen and constables
obtain fees out of the fines,
which makes it to the financial interest
of these officials to get as many cases
into court as possible. Many men I
have talked with have stated that the
constables often provoke disorder when
none exists for the sake of the profit
in the arrests. The Slavs know that
they are victimized, and at the same
time they realize their helplessness;
the natural result is a bitter contempt
for law.</p>

<p>"Huh!" sneered Vilchinsky, "the police
are busy enough all right stopping
disorder when the men have got
money. But when there's hard times,
like there is now, a man can make all
the noise he pleases and the police
won't arrest him. They know he hasn't
money to pay a heavy fine and costs.
It ain't law they think about. It's
money."</p>

<p>There are plenty of Slavs who are
quarrelsome, just as there are among
other races; and when you have a
combination of Slavic ill-temper and
the above-mentioned judicial practice,
then there is basis for trouble indeed.
Zavatsky and Yeremin, Russians, and
neighbors in a steel town, drank more
than was good for them one Saturday
afternoon in a saloon, and at last
Zavatsky spoke his mind about Yeremin's
wife, whom he did not consider
as good-looking as she should be,
and indulged in drunken threats
against her if she did not stop throwing
ashes on his side of the yard. Yeremin
repeated to his wife these threats
and remarks and Mrs. Yeremin, being
a choleric woman, went to the squire
in spite of the fact that it was very late
in the evening. But as it was payday,
he was in his office ready for business.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">

<div class="caption"><p><i>Drawn by Joseph Stella.</i></p>

<p>PITTSBURGH TYPES.</p>

<p>RUSSIAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A constable was sent to Zavatsky's
house to arrest him. The constable went
into the kitchen and, finding nobody
there or in the next room, went upstairs.
Here there were a number of boarders
talking, but they were not drunk. The
constable, seeing these men, thought it
would be wisest to have assistance, so
he brought two policemen and then went
for Zavatsky. They broke open the
door of the room where Zavatsky was
sleeping, dragged him out of bed and
told him to get up. He was in a drunken
stupor and claims that he did not resist
the constable, in fact, scarcely knew
what was going on; but the constable
felled him with so heavy a blow that it
made a scalp wound and the blood
rushed out and blinded him. While on
the floor, Zavatsky remembered a revolver
under his pillow, and raised his
hand and got it. The constable wrested
it from him and according to Mrs.
Zavatsky's version, he exclaimed, "I'll
give you a revolver, you son of a gun,"
and shot Zavatsky in the chest. Mrs.
Zavatsky, catching up a hammer, rushed
at the constable, but he knocked her
unconscious by a blow on the head and
she fell down in a swoon. Before that,
she had screamed to the men, "Come
down, boys, come down, they're killing
the gazda!" One of the first to come
to Zavatsky's assistance was his kum,
(the kum is one who is godfather to
one's children, or one to whose children
one is godfather; a very close relationship,&mdash;generally
the dearest friend). As
the kum tried to rush into the room, the
two officers gave him several violent
blows on the head. The other men rushed
down, but they were all seized by the officers,
with the exception of one whose
flight was suddenly stopped by a shot in
the leg.</p>

<p>As a result of the melee, the whole
household of ten men and one woman
was taken in patrol wagons to the
squire's court and committed to jail,
charged with disorderly conduct, felonious
assault and interference with an officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
in performance of his duty. Zavatsky
and the boarder who was shot in the leg
were sent to the hospital for treatment.
At first it looked as if Zavatsky were not
going to live. After a hearing four days
later they were all committed to the
grand jury, and my reports say that
they were all sentenced to jail for varying
periods. None of the policemen or
the constable had even a scratch to show,
although they charged these ten men with
felonious assault. The house, when I saw
it just following the affair, looked like the
day after a battle.</p>

<p>Not even so brief a sketch as this
would be complete without an instance
or two of the men who have been handicapped
by industrial accident. Such men
are met everywhere in Pittsburgh,&mdash;they
are so common as to excite no comment.
In proportion to their numbers, the Slavs
are the greatest sufferers from accident
in the Pittsburgh region, for to their
lot falls the heaviest and most dangerous
work. The report for 1905-1906 of
the National Croatian Society, to give
a general example of what industrial accident
means to the Slav, shows that out
of its membership which averaged about
17,000 for that period ninety-five men
were killed by accident [almost a third
of the deaths from all causes] and that
ninety-seven died from consumption, the
inception of which is often traceable to
the character of their work. In addition,
eighty-five other men were permanently
disabled.</p>

<p>Andrew Jurik's job was to run a
"skull-cracker" in the Homestead mill.
This is a contrivance to break up scrap
so that it can be easier melted, and its
main feature is a heavy steel ball which
is hoisted into the air and then allowed
to drop upon the scrap which has been
heaped beneath it. This crash of the
ball throws pieces of the scrap in all
directions. The work is very dangerous,
especially at night when it is hard to see
and dodge the flying scrap. One Monday
night [the day before he had worked
on a twenty-four hour shift] Jurik failed
to see and dodge. A chunk of scrap
weighing four or five hundred pounds
struck his leg and so crushed it that it had
to be amputated.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost a year after the accident I
went to visit Jurik, and found a mild-faced,
kindly-looking, not very intelligent
man of forty, sitting in his landlady's
kitchen rocking his landlady's baby. That
was Jurik's job now, to take care of
his landlady's children in part payment
for his board; and that was all he was
good for yet, for he had only a leg and
a stump. He had been paid $150 by
the Carnegie Relief Fund; of this he had
sent fifty dollars to his wife in Hungary
and had used the balance to pay his board.
The company had promised him an artificial
leg and light work as soon as he was
able to get around, but as his stump was
not yet entirely healed, as he had not a
cent, as his wife was writing him letters
begging for money for the children,
Jurik seemed worried.</p>

<p>Jurik looks at the future blankly, helplessly.
He had at first planned to bring
his family here, but now he can never
get the money for that. Nor can he
go back to them. He would be more
useless, more helpless, on a farm than
here. The only solution Jurik can see
to the lifelong problem suddenly thrust
upon him by that flying piece of scrap,
is for him and his family to remain indefinitely
apart: he working at whatever
poor job and at whatever low wage
he can get, and sending a little to Hungary
to help out,&mdash;his wife to continue
working as a laborer on a farm at twelve
or fifteen cents a day.</p>

<p>Often the handicapped man's problem
is thrust directly upon the wife
for solution, as it has been upon the
wife of John Hyrka. Hyrka is a Ruthenian
of thirty; his wife is twenty-eight.
He was making fair wages in
the Duquesne mills; they were both
healthy and strong, and they had high
hopes for the future as is natural with
the young. But May 26, 1907, John,
who was working on a platform directly
over a limestone mill, stepped on a
rotten plank and both his legs shot
down into the mill. Before he could
be extricated the flesh had been torn
from the soles of both his feet.</p>

<p>Since then (or at least up to the
time of my last report) Hyrka had
been in the McKeesport hospital,
where attempts were made to graft
flesh upon his soles. When I last
heard about him his feet were still not
healed, and it was practically certain
that the grafting would be a failure
and that he would be a cripple for life.</p>

<p>When this tragedy descended upon
Mrs. Hyrka she was within a month
of confinement. Into this grim situation
entered the baby, adding its cares.
Until months after the accident she
was in no condition to work, and when
she did regain her strength the demands
of the infant would not permit
her to take up regular employment.
For six months she lived upon thirty
dollars a month the company paid her,
then the company cut off this allowance,
and after she had felt the pinch
of want for a time, she demanded a final
settlement. They offered her $600,
she to pay all further hospital bills,
which up to then had been paid by the
company. She talked the matter over
with John, and between them they decided
that to have the flesh scraped
from your feet and to be a lifelong
cripple ought to be worth as much as
$1,000. But this seemed an exorbitant
estimate to the company, and as Mrs.
Hyrka held firm to her own figures,
the matter was still unsettled when I
left Pittsburgh. She was then living
on what she could borrow; the high
hopes of twenty-eight were all blasted;
she knew she had a cripple on her hands
for all his life, thirty or forty years perhaps,
and she was wondering, desperately
wondering, how she was going to be able
to support him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In citing these various types I have
not tried to make out the Slavs as better
than they are. I have, to repeat
my opening statement, merely tried to
show that these generally unknown
people are above all human beings,&mdash;that
they have not alone vices and undesirable
qualities, but virtues,&mdash;that
though crude, they have their possibilities.</p>

<p>To-day it is the young north-bound
Negro with whom we reckon in Pittsburgh.
Seldom is a white-headed Negro
seen on the street; but rather the man on
the sand cart hard at work. That with
every year there is an increasing migration
from the South to our northern cities
is known in a general way; but if our estimate
of these newcomers is to be worth
anything, it should be based upon something
more than impressions gained from
those we notice on the street-cars (the
best are too well-behaved to be conspicuous),
from loafers at saloon doors, and
from newspaper accounts of Negro crime.
Here, too often, the knowledge of white
people ends. Of the industrious, ambitious
Negroes, they know little; and of
the home life of those who are refined,
nothing at all. As a man who officially
comes into daily contact with the criminal
Negro said to me, "All must bear
the reproach for the doings of this police-court
ten per cent." Anyone who is sufficiently
interested to desire more accurate
information as to Pittsburgh's Negroes
than may be gained by a walk
down Wylie avenue will readily find
signs enough of the differentiation that is
rapidly taking place among the members
of this race. While with the increasing
influx a class of idle, shiftless Negroes
is coming, who create problems and increase
prejudice, a far larger number are
taking advantage of the abundance of
work and of the good wages, and are rapidly
bettering themselves. There is here
a chance, such as perhaps few northern
cities give, for the industrious Negro to
succeed, and he is improving his opportunity.</p>

<p>There was a considerable Negro population
in Allegheny county before the
Civil War. Both Pittsburgh and Allegheny
were important stations of the
"underground railroad" and many a man
and woman sought refuge here from the
nearby slave states. In Allegheny a
school was founded for them before the
end of the half century. The growth of
the Negro population is shown by the
following chart:</p>

<p>These figures show a steady increase
except from 1850 to 1860, gradually
reaching the point where the Negro population
doubles in a decade. The marked
increases from 1870 to 1880 and 1890 to
1900 are probably due to the fact that in
those periods more Negroes were able
to get work in the steel mills. The percentage
of Negroes in the total population
of the county was 2.2 per cent in
1880, 2.4 per cent in 1890, and 3.6 per
cent in 1900. Three-quarters of the
Negroes in the county live in Pittsburgh
and Allegheny City. Since 1900, the
migration of Negroes to Pittsburgh has
been greater than before. It is estimated
that there are not less than 50,000 in
Allegheny county and at least 35,000 of
these are in Pittsburgh and Allegheny.
In 1900 considerably more than half of
these were males, and Pittsburgh was one
of three cities in the United States (the
others were Chicago and Boston) with a
population of 10,000 or more Negroes,
to have an excess of males.</p>

<p>In general this migration has been
from the middle southern states. The
greater number, fully one-half, has come
from Virginia and West Virginia; others
have come from Georgia, Alabama and
Tennessee, with a few from Ohio and
states further west. Some of those from
Alabama and Tennessee have already
been "broken in" in the new mill districts
of those states.</p>

<p>As in the migration to other northern
cities most of these people, when they
come north, are in their best working
years,&mdash;between eighteen and forty. According
to the census of 1900, over seventy
per cent of the Pittsburgh Negroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
were between fifteen and fifty-four years
of age; less than five per cent were over
fifty years, while but fourteen per cent,
about 2,400, were children of school age,
between five and fourteen. Many of the
children remain in the South, and many
of the old people go back there, so that
the city of Pittsburgh is under little expense
for educating the children and less
for caring for the aged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The principal Negro street is Wylie
avenue. This leads up to the "Hill District"
which, forty years ago, was a well-conditioned
section. Now it is given over
largely to Negroes and European immigrants.
Forty-eight per cent of the Negroes
in Pittsburgh live in wards seven,
eight, eleven and thirteen. In 1900, sixteen
per cent were in the thirteenth ward,
and the number has increased since then.
They constituted fourteen per cent of the
total population of the ward in that year.
How fast this movement into the thirteenth
ward is taking place is indicated
by what a colored woman told me who
keeps a grocery store on Wylie avenue
near Francis street. When she opened
there three years ago, there was scarcely
a colored family in the district. Now
there is another grocery store, a shoe
store and two confectionery stores, kept
by colored people. Horton street near
by is filled with colored people who have
recently come from the South. There is
a tendency on the part of the Negroes,
however, to get out from the center of
the city, and fully a quarter of them lives
further out in wards nineteen, twenty and
twenty-one. In all, sixty-two per cent
of the Negroes lived in 1900 in six wards.</p>

<p>In these wards there is a large foreign
element. In the seventh, eighth and eleventh
wards there are many Russian Jews.
A Negro church in the eighth ward was
sold last fall for a Jewish synagog, and
the Negro congregation is building in the
thirteenth ward. In the twelfth ward
where many of the Negroes live who
work in the mills, they have for neighbors
the Poles and Slavs. The well-to-do Negroes
of the city are moving out towards
the East End.</p>

<p>Two or three apartment houses have
been built especially for Negroes, but in
general, though living in certain localities,
they are not segregated. This does not
mean that there are not some Negro
streets, but very often a row of from
three to seven houses will be found in
which Negroes are living, while the rest
of the street is filled with white people.
Again, a single Negro family may live
between two white families. When Negroes
gain a foothold in a new street in
any numbers, the Americans move away;
but the Jewish immigrants do not seem
to object to living near them, sometimes
in the same house. And this is true of
more than the poorest of them.</p>

<p>In a way the Jews have been a help to
the Negroes, for they will rent houses to
them in localities where they could not
otherwise go. In many cases the Jews
have bought or built houses, filled them
with Negro tenants at high rents, and
thus paid for them. But the Negroes
have learned from these experiences and
many of them have started to buy homes.
They have decided that they might as
well buy houses for themselves as for the
Jews.</p>

<p>The poorer Negroes live in a network
of alleys on either side of Wylie avenue
in the seventh and eighth wards. For
years the conditions here have been very
bad from every point of view. There are
respectable people living here, but the
population consists chiefly of poor Negroes
and a low class of whites. As a
result, there is much immorality in this
section,&mdash;speak easies, cocaine joints and
disorderly houses abound. I think I
never saw such wretched conditions as in
three shanties on Poplar alley. Until a
year ago many of the landlords had not
complied with the law requiring flush
closets, and I found old fashioned vaults
full of filth. Where the flush closets
had been put in they were in many cases
out of repair. In some alleys there were
stables next to the houses and while the
odor was bad at any time, after a rain
the stench from these and from the dirt
in the streets was almost unendurable.</p>

<p>The interiors of very many of the
houses in which the Negroes live were
out of repair,&mdash;paper torn off, plastering
coming down, and windows broken. The
tenants told me they had complained to
the landlords and had tried to get something
done, but without success.</p>

<p>The twelfth ward near the mills also
has some bad conditions. In Parke row
and Spruce alley, on the day of my visit,
the rubbish, which is removed only every
two weeks, was piled high. On top of
one pile was an old dirty mattress. The
houses I visited in Parke row were so dark
that it was necessary to use a lamp even
at midday. There were also depressing
conditions among the Negro homes on
Rose, Charles and Soho streets. While
some of the more ambitious are moving
out from these unhealthy localities, many
who would like to move have not the opportunity.
One of these said to me,
"The only place where there is plenty
of room for Negroes is in the alleys."</p>

<p>Yet even the very poorest Negro homes
are usually clean inside and have a homelike
air. It would surprise one who has
never visited such homes to see with what
good taste they are furnished. There is
always some attempt at ornamentation,
oftenest expressed by a fancy lamp, which
is probably never lighted. Almost every
family except the very poorest has a
piano. The best Negro houses,&mdash;usually
not in Negro districts,&mdash;are what people
of the same means have everywhere. I
was fortunate enough to visit at least a
dozen of these comfortable, well-furnished,
attractive homes and in them I
met courteous, gracious and refined women.
Only in Spruce alley and Parke row
did I find disorder and a general indifference
to dirt and there were some exceptions
even there. The hopelessness of
keeping clean in such a location may have
had something to do with these conditions.</p>

<p>Compared with certain of the foreigners,
the Negroes do not overcrowd their
houses, but they do often shelter too many
people for comfort or decency. I visited
a house of three rooms where a man and
wife, five children and a boarder were
living. In another house, also of three
rooms, there were a man and his wife,
her mother, two children and a lodger.
These I think are not unusual cases. I
also found a family of ten in four rooms,
and another family of seven and a boarder
in three rooms. Where a house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
four rooms is taken by two families, they
do not often take lodgers, but if one family
takes such a house it usually cannot
meet the expense alone. What is more
serious than the number of people in a
house, is the carelessness in allowing
young girls to sleep in the same room
with men lodgers. Such a case was that
reported by a probation officer of the
Juvenile Court, of a girl of fifteen who
slept in the same room with her father,
two brothers and a lodger. It was "nothing,"
she told the court; the man was
"an old friend of the family." The suggestion
that she occupy the vacant room
in the house plainly surprised her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The low ebb of living conditions in a
Negro neighborhood is illustrated by
Jack's Run, a narrow, deep ravine leading
down to the Ohio river between Bellevue
and Allegheny. Here, during the past
six or seven years, about one hundred
and seventy-five colored people from the
rural districts of North Carolina and
Virginia have found lodgement. Engaged
chiefly in domestic service and common
labor, they have settled here because the
rents are cheap. Mixed in with them is a
class of low whites, and the standards of
civilization are sucked down by immorality
and neglect, for the run is practically
isolated from the rest of the world. A
mission Sunday school connected with
the white Presbyterian church in Bellevue
has been held there for about five
years. The superintendent of this mission,
who is a colored man, has endeavored
to reach the children of the run.
As he feels the Sunday school alone cannot
do this, he is working to get a day
school there. To be sure, the children are
enrolled in Bellevue or Allegheny, but
he says they really do not attend. A long
climb up the hills shuts them off, and the
white children pester them when they
show themselves. It is hard to know
what could be done to better the conditions
in a place like Jack's Run, but up to
the present time, with the exception of
this one man, few people have tried to find
out. The run has few visitors, and these
are not altruists. "I have seen a politician
here," the superintendent told me,
"and an insurance collector; but never a
preacher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most encouraging signs of
the economic progress of the Pittsburgh
Negroes is found in the variety of occupations
in which they are engaged. In
1900, 146 were engaged in professions:
actors, artists, clergymen, dentists, engineers,
lawyers, physicians and others.
Domestic and personal service, house
servants, barbers, janitors, hotel and restaurant
keepers, soldiers, policemen, etc.,
employed 6,618; while in trade, and
transportation, clerks, teamsters, merchants,
railway employes, telephone operators,
etc., there were 1,612. Manufacturing
and mechanical pursuits employed
1,365. There was a total of 10,456
Negro wage earners: 8,382 males and
2,074 females. The proportion of those
engaged in professional pursuits is
small,&mdash;only a little over one per cent; and,
with one exception, the number does not
seem to be increasing. In Pittsburgh and
the vicinity there are now eighteen Negro
physicians, about three times as many
as in 1900. Six were graduated from
Harvard University, five from the Western
University of Pennsylvania, two from
Shaw, and one each from Ohio State,
Medico-Chirurgical, and Western Reserve.
Four of these men took also the
degree of A. B. Ten have practiced five
years or less. Among the five practicing
lawyers is one graduate of the Harvard
Law School, one from New York University
Law School and one from Harvard
University Law School. Two of
these lawyers were admitted to the bar
in 1891. They were the first Negroes to
be admitted in Western Pennsylvania, as
all who had applied up to that time had
been turned down. There are four Negro
dentists.</p>

<p>Most of the men in these three professions
have some practice among white
people. A young physician who has been
in Allegheny about three years, and who
at first had such difficulty in renting an
office in a suitable location that he almost
gave up in despair, has now a number
of white patients. One of the first
was a German girl to whom he was called
at the time of an accident because he happened
to live near by, and through her
family he has been recommended to other
white people.</p>

<p>Newspapers conducted by Negroes
have not flourished in Pittsburgh but last
year there were two,&mdash;the <i>Pioneer</i>, a
small sheet run in the interests of the
Baptists, and the <i>Progressive Afro-American</i>,
a weekly.</p>

<p>Twenty per cent of the men follow
manufacturing and mechanical pursuits.
Because of the abundance of work good
Negro mechanics have no difficulty in
keeping busy, though they have made
little headway in the unions. An occasional
Negro is a union member, as, for
instance, four or five carpenters, a few
stone-masons and a few plasterers.
Here, as elsewhere, they gain admission
easily only to the hardest kinds of work.
The Negro hod carriers indeed make up
the greater part of the hod carriers union.
In McKeesport there are but two white
hod carriers. In Pittsburgh and the vicinity
there are over a thousand colored
hod carriers. The colored stationary
engineers and firemen have a union of
their own, the National Association of
Afro-American Steam and Gas Engineers
and Skilled Laborers, incorporated June,
1903. It was once a part of a white organization.
It has three locals in Pittsburgh
and it has been allied with other
labor organizations and represented in
central labor bodies, but it is yet rather
weak. Three or four colored contractors
hire plasterers and masons.</p>

<p>Early in the seventies a few colored
men found work in some of the mills.
One of the first to employ Negroes was
the Black Diamond Mill on Thirtieth
street. There were a few here before
1878. In that year, through a strike,
Negro puddlers were put in, and since
then the force of puddlers has been made
up largely of Negroes. About the same
time Negroes were taken into the Moorhead
Mill at Sharpsburg, and also
through a strike, Negroes got into the
Clark Mills on Thirty-fifth street. Since
1892, there have been Negroes in the
Carnegie Mills at Homestead. It is the
prevailing impression that numbers of
Negro strike-breakers were imported at
the time of the "big strike," but I have
been told by an official of the Carnegie
company, by a leading colored resident
of Homestead, and by a Negro who went
to work in the Homestead Mills in 1892,
that this was not so. Word was given
out that anyone could find work who
would come, the Negroes with the rest.
Negroes were brought up from the
South at this time to take the place of
strikers in the Clark Mills. But Negroes
already worked there and some
of them who went out at that time
eventually went back to work. Unquestionably
Negro strike-breakers have
been brought to Pittsburgh, but I judge
not in any large numbers. When the
mills were last running full there were
about one hundred and twenty Negroes
at the Clark Mills; one hundred and
twenty-six at Homestead, and about 100
in the other mills of the Carnegie company,
making in all the Carnegie works
three hundred and forty-six colored
men. A conservative estimate would put
those at the Black Diamond and Moorhead
Mills as at least three hundred
more. Many of these mill men are unskilled,
but at the Clark Mills two-thirds,
and at Homestead nearly half are skilled
or semi-skilled. It is possible for a man
of ability to work up to a good position.</p>

<p>A small but increasing number of Negroes
are on the city's payroll. On the
date of my inquiry there were in the
employ of the city of Pittsburgh 127
persons of Afro-American descent, or
one out of every 237 of the Negro population,
while a total of 635 directly profited
by the $91,942 paid annually in salaries
to colored persons. These city employes
include laborers, messengers,
janitors, policemen, detectives, firemen,
letter carriers and postal clerks, and their
salaries range from $550 to $1,500 a
year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first Negroes to set up establishments
of their own, dating back twenty
years and more, were the barbers and
hairdressers. Formerly these had much
of the white patronage, but they are
gradually losing it. With a few exceptions,
notably the Negro barber in the
Union Station, their shops are now
found on Wylie avenue and in other Negro
localities, and are patronized by
Negroes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Furnished by R. R. Wright, Jr., of the Armstrong
Association, Philadelphia, who investigated
the Negro in Business in Pennsylvania for the
Carnegie Institution.</p></div>

<p>The number employed does not include
the proprietors, so that over six
hundred persons are earning a living
from these shops. Not counting the
barber shops, saloons or restaurants,
there are certainly over one hundred
small stores kept by Negroes and until
the financial depression new ones were
opening each month. Three or four
drug stores were opened in 1907. One
of the Negro hotels doubled its capacity
in a year.</p>

<p>The nine business enterprises listed
under "miscellaneous" include an insurance
company, a stationery and book
store, a men's furnishing store, a photographer's
gallery, a real estate company,
a loan company, a shoe store and repairing
shop, and a manufactory of a
hair growing preparation, which has
sent out sixty-five agents. The insurance
company has twenty-eight agents,
all of whom are colored. Several of the
barbers have laundry agencies and boot-blacking
stands and some have baths.
There are at least a dozen men who
own their horses and wagons and take
contracts for hauling and excavating.
One of the largest of these Negro contractors
was employing 135 men. Another
employs thirty men for hauling and
also works 100 to 200 men on asphalt
paving. There are many more men who
own a horse or two and do general expressing.
One of these told me that he
spent his first one hundred and fifty dollars
saved after coming to Pittsburgh
for a horse, which left him with a capital
of seventy-five cents. He now owns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>four horses. A Negro has had one of the
stalls in the Allegheny Market for many
years and there is another in the Diamond
Market.</p>

<p>One of the most successful Negro
business men lives in Homestead. As
a small boy he moved from Virginia to
Ohio, and came to Homestead in 1879.
Up to 1890 he was an engineer on the
river, the only Negro to hold a chief
engineer's license. Then he went into
boat building and built twenty-one river
steamboats. Five years ago he organized
the Diamond Coke and Coal Company,
in which he is now master of
transportation. There are ten men in
this company; the others are white. They
own a mine, docks, and steamboats, and
employ about a thousand men. This
colored man owns considerable property.
He lives in a large comfortable house
and owns one on either side which he
rents. His older son entered Penn Medical
School last fall. His younger son
was captain of the Homestead High
School football team. His daughter,
who graduated from the high school and
had an additional three years at the California
Normal School, is teaching in
the South. She could not get a school
in Homestead.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the Pittsburgh Negroes
show an encouraging variety in
their independent business enterprises as
well as in their general occupations. Of
course they have usually been able to
go into only those that require small
capital. The Negro who comes to Pittsburgh
or any northern city with no capital,
no business experience and no business
traditions, and succeeds even in a
small way in the midst of such competition
as he must face, is doing remarkably
well.</p>

<p>But the mass of the Negroes in Pittsburgh
are found in the same occupations
that are open to them in most northern
cities with perhaps fewer men (fifty-eight
per cent) and rather more women
(ninety per cent) in domestic and personal
service, and more men in manufacturing
and mechanical pursuits than
is usual. This shifting of the men's activities
is due to the nature of the industries
in Pittsburgh, to the fact that the
city is rapidly growing and consequently
that there is much building going on in
which labor can be utilized, and to the
fact that Negroes gained a foothold in
some of the mills during the strike periods.
While the largest and best hotels
no longer have colored waiters, many
are still employed in hotels, restaurants
and caf&eacute;s. Comparatively few Negroes
are employed as porters and helpers in
stores while large numbers are employed
as teamsters, probably more now than in
1900, as most of the sand wagons and
other hauling carts are driven by them.
There are also many coachmen and
chauffeurs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the Negro men find a varied
field for their labor, comparatively few
occupations are open to colored women.
There is one woman who has conducted
a very successful hairdressing establishment
for twenty years and a half dozen
others have opened little shops. A dozen
or so find work as clerks and stenographers
in offices and stores of colored men,
but most are working as maids or laundresses.
There are about a hundred
dressmakers and seamstresses. That
there is not a greater variety of openings
for colored women works a great
hardship. There is no hospital where
they can be trained as nurses; there is
no place for them in the department
stores, except for a few as maids; they
can look forward to no positions in the
public schools. Many who would stay
and graduate from the high school drop
out because they see nothing ahead.
They are, of course, unwise in doing
this, for more than most girls they need
to take advantage of every educational
opportunity. A woman who is a stenographer
in a Negro insurance office,
said her father thought she was very
foolish to study stenography as he was
sure she could never get a chance to
use it. She went into this office to write
policies. When the agent found she was
competent to do the higher work, he let
his white stenographer go and gave her
the place. Another woman told me that
her daughter seriously objected to going
to the high school; she said she could
never use what she would learn there.
But her parents felt able to send her, and
insisted that she graduate. She is now
employed in the court house at a salary
of $600 a year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1900 the Negroes of Allegheny
county paid taxes on property valued at
$963,000. Since that time wage-earning
Negroes have commenced to buy homes
in still larger numbers. They usually
pay something down and the rest as
rent until the entire sum is paid. In
Beltzhoover there is a settlement of a
hundred or more families more than half
of whom are buying homes. To buy a
house of any kind on small wages means
industry and many little sacrifices. One
couple whom I visited in Beltzhoover
were buying a house of five rooms with
a piazza and a generous sized front yard.
The husband, when he was married, had
saved $300, which went for the first
payment. In the four years since then
they had paid $800 and they had $1,000
more to pay. He was a janitor getting
forty-eight dollars a month, while his
wife made six dollars a week as a seamstress.
To increase their income, they
rented out a room to a man and his wife
who paid them ten dollars a month. They
also raised and sold chickens which
brought in additional money. Most of
the houses which colored people of this
class are buying are valued at from
$2,500 to $3,300. On Francis street, near
Wylie avenue, there is a group of five
six-room houses occupied by Negroes.
Three of these families were buying their
houses. One of the men was a waiter,
one a porter in a bank, and one owned a
horse and wagon and did expressing.</p>

<p>The following experience, told me by
a Tuskegee graduate, is an example of
what may be done in Pittsburgh by an
industrious Negro who is ambitious to
establish a home: "I came to Pittsburgh
in March, 1900," he said, "on a
freight train, arriving about three <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>
I asked for the police station, but they
wouldn't let me stay there when they
found I had fifty cents in my pocket. I
was turned up Wylie avenue and finally
came to a colored lodging house. All
the beds were full, but they said that I
could sit in the rocking chair for the
balance of the night for a quarter. The
next morning I started out to look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
work and found it in a brick yard where
I worked until August. Meanwhile I
sent for my wife and child. My wife,
who is a dressmaker, soon found work.
She happened to sew for the wife of the
manager of one of the steel mills. He
asked about me and said he thought he
could give me something good in the
mill. I went there in August and have
been there ever since. Now I am a heater.
All you see here was gotten together
in the last seven years." This
man and his wife have paid $4,400 for a
six-room house and have furnished it
attractively.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The churches have the same prominent
place in Negro life in Pittsburgh as elsewhere.
They include one Presbyterian,
one Protestant Episcopal, one Congregational,
one Roman Catholic church,
ten Methodist churches and between thirty
and thirty-five Baptist churches and
missions. The largest is the Bethel A.
M. E. Church on Wylie avenue, which
has recently been built at a cost of $50,000.
Colored slaters and roofers, colored
plasterers and three colored carpenters
were employed in the building of it.
The interior decorations were in charge
of a Negro firm. The building together
with the land, is valued at not less than
$110,000. The people give liberally to
the churches; Bethel raised over $10,000
in ten months toward paying off its
mortgage.</p>

<p>But there is a large number not reached
by the church in any real sense.
Though the new Bethel Church is in a
district where the alleys and all the bad
conditions they imply are numerous, the
pastor's plans for the year as he outlined
them were: first to pay the debt
on the church, second to have a revival
to fill it up. Not a word was said of
the great need for active social work at
its very doors. The rank and file of the
forty or fifty Negro ministers in Pittsburgh
and Allegheny have not a very
high order of equipment or ethics. There
are notable exceptions. I met one minister
who seemed filled with the desire
to work for the betterment of the Negroes
of his neighborhood. In connection
with the new church which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
building he was planning to have a day
nursery and kindergarten and, if possible,
a gymnasium. He hoped to have
a deaconess to visit the homes and was
also trying to organize a colored Y. M.
C. A. At a meeting last fall in his
church, the following subjects were discussed:</p>

<p>"What is the influence of the Sunday
School on the children?"</p>

<p>"Is the church accomplishing the desired
end toward the masses?"</p>

<p>"Practical education and character
making for the masses."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some of the laymen among the colored
people, especially the women, are
working in similar directions. In 1880,
in a small six-room house, a group of
these started a Home for Aged and Infirm
Colored Women. The present
beautiful home on Lexington avenue was
built in 1900 at a cost of $42,500. It
contains twenty-one rooms, six bath
rooms and a hospital room. The furnishings
cost about $28,000. Several
rooms were furnished by the different
Negro women's social clubs. The home
is attractive, cheery, clean and well-managed.
The Working Girls' Home was
similarly started three years ago by some
colored women who realized how much
it was needed. Girls coming to the city
not only found it difficult to get boarding
places, but they were sometimes directed
to undesirable houses. In three
years after it opened, the home had cared
for forty to fifty girls. As most of these
girls go out to service, they do not remain
long at the home, but by paying a
dollar a month a girl may store her
trunk if she wishes, and may come back
there to spend Sundays and other days
"out," and to receive her callers. This
is an arrangement which is much appreciated
by the girls, and its introduction
in other places might help solve
the servant problem. A few girls who
are seamstresses live in the house. They
pay $1.25 a week, buy their own provisions,
and have the use of the kitchen
and gas range. The home has had a
struggle financially. Last year the Legislature
granted it an appropriation of
$3,000 and it moved into a somewhat
larger, though still too small house.
For this house, by the way, it had to
pay thirty-two dollars a month though the
rent had formerly been twenty-five and
the house had been empty for some time.</p>

<p>The State Federation of Colored Women's
Clubs formed five years ago, is raising
money to establish a colored orphan's
home in New Castle, Pennsylvania. A
year ago these twenty-eight clubs had
already raised enough to make the first
payment on seven acres of land. The
Colored Orphans' Home in Allegheny is
under white management, and the colored
women are ambitious to have one of
their own; a colored auxiliary to the
Juvenile Court Association was formed
in 1906 to care for colored boys and girls
between nine and twelve years of age who
are brought to the court. The auxiliary
also pays board for a group of colored
children who are in institutions outside
the state. One member is a faithful volunteer
at the Juvenile Court.</p>

<p>More than twenty-five social clubs are
formed of colored women. The leading
social organization for men is the Loendi
Club. Besides this and other private associations
there are many such orders
as the Odd Fellows, Masons, Elks,
Knights of Pythias and True Reformers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since 1874, when separate schools for
Negroes were abolished, the colored children
have attended the public schools
with the white children, and all the educational
agencies of the city are open
to them. I was told that while a few
stood well in their classes, the majority
lacked concentration. One principal attributed
this to the impoverished home
conditions, lack of food and housing,&mdash;while
another principal to whose school
came many of the children from the alleys,
laid their backwardness largely to
their irregular attendance and immoral
tendencies. It was agreed that the average
colored child requires about two
years longer than the white child to finish
the grammar grades.</p>

<p>The total enrollment at the high school
for the year 1906-7 was about 2,300, and
of these only forty were colored. Forty-two
were enrolled last year, twenty boys
and ten girls<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. Few of these colored students
graduate. Five who were graduated
in 1907 ranked well in their class.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Transcriber 20 + 10 obviously does not equal 42</p></div>

<p>Thirty colored students attended the
evening high school last year. Two girls
are in the day classes, and four in the
night classes at the Carnegie Technical
Schools, and they have three colored
boys. Five or six boys have been graduated
from the Schwab Manual Training
School in Homestead.</p>

<p>In writing of the Negroes of Chicago,
Mr. Wright says "What Chicago Negroes
need is a great industrial school
to teach Negroes domestic science and
the skilled trades." Greater Pittsburgh
has a school that should do this work.
As early as 1849, Charles Avery, a Methodist
minister of Quaker descent, who
was much interested in the colored people,
established for them in Allegheny
the Avery College Trade School. At
his death he left the institution an endowment
of $60,000 which has since increased
in value, and it has also received
a yearly appropriation from the state.
The school is controlled by a board of
trustees, of whom six are colored, three
white. The principal and teachers are
colored. The courses which have been
offered include millinery, dressmaking,
tailoring, music, some English courses
and some domestic science. Last spring,
a hospital department was organized under
separate charter and offers a training
course.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Avery
school is not fulfilling the purpose for
which it was founded. It is inferior in
equipment and in methods and does not
employ trained teachers. It is not reaching
the colored boys and girls of Pittsburgh
and giving them the up-to-date
training which they so sorely need in
those trades in which they can earn a
livelihood. It should be crowded and
would be if it were offering what the
people want. Instead the enrollment at
the end of the school year is about one-third
what it was at the beginning.
There is no difficulty in placing responsibility
for success or failure, for the
superintendent is also secretary and
treasurer. The colored people have
brought many complaints to the trustees
in regard to the management of Avery
but no action has been taken. Here is
a clear cut illustration of a badly managed
trust fund.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Avery also left twelve scholarships
of $100 each to be awarded to
colored boys in the college and engineering
departments of the University of
Pittsburgh, where a total of nineteen
colored students is enrolled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the 1,124 cases brought before the
Juvenile Court in 1906, 168 (14.9 per
cent), dealt with colored children.
The court records show most miserable
conditions in the homes from which such
children come. Usually both mother
and father are working away from home
all day, so that out of school hours there
is no one to look after the children. They
stop going to school and begin to stay
out late at night and the descent to petty
thieving and other offenses is swift and
easy. On the morning of my visit to
the Juvenile Court several colored children
were brought before the judge.
Harry D., a boy of eleven years, was
under arrest for his second offense.
Twice he had broken into a chapel, the
last time stealing a lamp. The probation
officer reported that on investigation,
she found Harry had scarcely been
in school for a year. His mother worked
all day, earning three dollars a week
and many days she came home only
early in the morning to cook. With
three brothers and a sister this boy
slept on a cot in one room in which
there was no other furniture except two
plush chairs and a plush sofa. An uncle
who lived with the children had taken
to drinking and had not worked for
some weeks. The neighbors also bore
testimony that Harry was neglected
rather than bad. Following Harry came
a group of four colored boys on the
charge that on the previous Sunday
they had broken into a liquor store and
done much mischief, such as turning
on the spigots, breaking bottles full of
beer and smearing pretty much everything
in the store, including some cats,
with black paint. The next morning
they were arrested in a new house near
by where they were stealing lead pipe.
Eugene, the youngest boy, nine years
old, had been in court two months before
on the charge of incorrigibility.
His father was dead but his mother, by
working out by the day, managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
keep the home fairly clean and comfortable.
But Eugene was a truant; he
stayed out nights and was in the habit of
stealing. For the lack of a more suitable
solution, this nine-year-old child
was committed to the reformatory at
Morganza. Two of these boys, thirteen
and eleven, were brothers. Their mother
was dead; their father was at work
in a blast furnace, while their nineteen-year-old
sister, who might have kept the
home, had left soon after the mother
died because she thought her father was
too strict. The younger boy had been
staying out nights and playing truant.
The older boy had never been in trouble
before. He had a good reputation and
claimed, as did the fourth boy, that he
was not stealing but was trying to get
the others away. In other cases that
came before the judge the parents were
themselves immoral and it is safe to say
that the colored children who reach the
Juvenile Court have, as a rule, seen little
but the seamy side of life. A ready
market for any bottle or piece of junk
that these children can beg or steal is
found among the numerous junk dealers.
The children will be under a constant
temptation to petty thieving for
the sake of a few pennies so long as this
kind of exchange with juveniles is
allowed.</p>

<p>The percentage of commitments
among the adult Negroes (fourteen per
cent), is all out of proportion to their
percentage in the population (three and
six-tenths). Women are most commonly
arrested for disorderly conduct; men
for fighting and cutting, petit larceny
and for gambling, of which craps is the
favorite form. There is much drunkenness.
For some time the police department
of Pittsburgh has been warring
against the sale of cocaine. To the
mind of the warden of the Allegheny
county jail the greatest single cause of
crime committed by Negro men and
women is the use of this drug.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is evident that the Negroes of Pittsburgh
are making commendable progress
along industrial lines. Some few have
been conspicuously successful while many
more are earning a comfortable living
and attaining property. Negroes of this
class present no special problems, for they
are usually good citizens and are educating
and training their children to be good
citizens likewise. Their needs are the
needs of the rest of the community. They
would be benefited by better housing,
better schools, better sanitation and a
clearer atmosphere. But the problems in
connection with the poor, ignorant, incompetent
or vicious Negroes are many
and pressing.</p>

<p>We have seen the need for eradicating
the sale of cocaine, which drags men under;
and we have seen the need for rousing
and equipping the ambitious among
them through industrial training, comparable
to that offered the southern Negro
by Tuskegee and Hampton. A few
of the more obvious needs of the people
who live in the alleys are day nurseries
to care for the babies of mothers who
must go out to work; some sort of supervised
play after school hours, either
in connection with the schools or at playgrounds,
for the older children of these
same families, settlements; and most
pressing of all, a building on lower Wylie
avenue for social purposes with free
baths, club rooms, a gymnasium and other
amusements as a counteracting influence
to the saloons and pool rooms that
abound in this neighborhood. There is
now no place in Pittsburgh where a
young colored man, coming a stranger to
the city, as so many are coming every
year, may find innocent diversion and
helpful companionship. It is becoming
increasingly clear that these needs must
be met by the Negroes themselves. A
few, singly or in small groups, are already
working for social betterment, but
so far there has been no concerted, organized
action. Left to themselves the
Negroes are slow or unable to organize
but until they do, much of their efforts as
individuals will be wasted and but little
definite good can be accomplished. If
the white people who have had greater
experience in dealing with civic and social
needs realized this and extended to
them their co-operation, the community
as a whole, no less than the Negroes,
would be richly repaid.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></div>

<p>The greater part of the Jewish community
of Pittsburgh is situated in what
is known as the Hill District. This immigration
brings with it characteristics
so entirely its own that much that
is significant of the common life was
found summed up in a study of the families
of two blocks in the heart of this
district. A census of them proved more
surely than even those of us who had
long been residents in the neighborhood
would have anticipated, the permanence
and stability of this new element
in the population. The two blocks reflected
the sort of foothold which is open
to this distinctive people in what is for
most purposes, a purely industrial center;
what relation their new occupations
bear to their training and experience in
the old countries of Europe; and what, as
measured in terms of livelihood and accomplishment,
comes to them in this new
setting.</p>

<p>The blocks selected were two adjoining
Center avenue at different points on
the incline of the hill. Pittsburgh has
no really large tenement houses. These
homes were originally built for two families,
and while some still contain but
two, many have been converted so as to
house a great many more. In the process
of rebuilding, downstairs front-rooms
have been changed into small
stores where grocers, butchers and tailors
supply the needs of the neighborhood.
The houses are of brick, and
many are garnished by a government license
sign, which indicates that somewhere
in these already crowded quarters,
a small stogy-factory is located which
sells in the larger market. The many
synagogs where the men still wear the
old time praying shawls, and each repeats
for himself in monotonous, low,
musical tones the ancient Hebrew prayers,
bring into this capital of the steel
district, the wonderful and fascinating
spirit of the East. The Cheders where
the Hebrew language, which every hardworking
father and mother, no matter
what else is sacrificed, feel must be
taught to the boys, and the Kosher
butcher-shops, where the dietary laws
are still observed, are all distinctive of a
people, which though it adopts American
customs, still keeps many of the traditions
in its own communal life.</p>

<p>There were 1,080 people in these
blocks, 817 of whom were Jewish. Of
the 143 Jewish families, 110 were from
Russia, twenty-seven from Roumania,
five from Austria-Hungary and one from
Germany,&mdash;all largely from small towns.
Among them there were very nearly
three hundred children of school age
or younger.</p>

<p>A third of these families had been in
America over ten years and two-thirds
over five years. Of course, the fact that
the census was taken in a year of industrial
depression may have had a large
influence on the comparatively small number
of more recent immigrants in residence
in the neighborhood, for these
would have less resources to keep them
in Pittsburgh during a period of hard
times. But the actual number of stable
family groups was very considerable as
shown in the following classification:</p>

<table class="tdc" cellpadding="4" summary="actual number of stable
family groups">
<tr><th></th><th><i>Under 2</i></th><th>  <i>2 to 5</i>,</th><th> <i>5 to 10</i>,</th><th> <i>10 to 20</i>,</th><th> <i>20 to 40</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Years in America</td><td>10</td><td>   33 </td><td>  50</td><td>  32 </td><td>  18</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Years in Pittsburgh</td><td>  12</td><td>  36</td><td>  49</td><td>  29</td><td>   17</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This permanence as an element in the
citizenship of Pittsburgh is in contrast
to an uninterrupted shifting among them
as tenants. On the one hand, the latter
is merely a reflex of the success of particular
families in making their way and
raising their standard of life; but the
greater part of it is due to the lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
proper houses at a fair rental in Pittsburgh.
It is a common occurrence for
a family to move from place to place in
an effort to secure more livable quarters.
One family went through the torture
of moving six times in one year.
Two have lived from ten to twenty years
in the same place, eight from five to ten,
forty-six over two, while eighty-seven
had been living in their present homes
less than two years.</p>

<p>Unsuspected by the casual visitor, there
is a background of tragedy and national
crises to such a neighborhood. Among
the great nations of Europe, Russia and
Roumania have absolutely refused political
and industrial freedom to their Jewish
subjects. The concrete forms which
oppression and restriction assume are
very real: prohibitions against their owning
land, their exclusion in one part
of Russia from the learned professions,
in another from taking part in a government
contract, and in whole districts from
owning their own homes. Here in these
blocks there are many families who have
lived and traded in daily terror of an outbreak
or of the tyranny of an unscrupulous
governor; who have been deprived
of the rights and privileges of citizens
and yet subjected to the full strain of
military law and the brunt of religious
persecution. You chance to meet a man
in the corner grocery,&mdash;he is tall and
gaunt; his long beard is well sprinkled
with grey. On talking with him you
find he has served in the Russo-Turkish
War, that his only son served for four
years in the Russian army, and that a
"pogrom" finally drove him to leave everything
behind and flee to these shores.
One man was robbed and his family outraged,&mdash;a
son and brother-in-law killed in
a recent massacre; another man already
past forty, had to take up his burden, and,
like the pilgrims of old, go forth and
search for a new home, because the edict
had been given in Moscow.</p>

<p>It was found that forty-one of the families
had come for purely religious and
political reasons, ninety-two to better
their economic condition and thirty-four
had followed relatives, friends and
townsmen who either sent for them or
urged them to make the journey. Indeed,
this personal relationship is on
many counts the most important factor
in swelling the population of a Jewish
neighborhood. As a rule, no matter
how poor the immigrant may be, he
saves, often by the most drastic measures,
to send for some loved ones. Such
was the experience of a young man, educated
in the public schools of Roumania,
who had suffered in the uprisings there.
His first employment in Pittsburgh was
with a local druggist. He went through
the usual apprenticeship, and soon another
brother had come over and was
working as a barber. They saved and
sent part of their earnings to their parents
in the old country, while the first, by
work and study, prepared himself for entrance
into the local college of pharmacy,
was graduated and his earning capacity
thereby increased. Then, the parents, a
sister and two brothers were brought
over and, when an opportunity for buying
a drug store offered itself to him, the
combined forces of the family made the
purchase possible. To-day, after eight
years of hard work, he owns a well-established
business, is married and the entire
family seems well started on the road
to success.</p>

<p>The question of what a man does, when
he comes here an uninterpreted stranger,
is interestingly reflected in these two
blocks. The stogy industry and peddling
are dominant; of those who have
become stogy-makers, four were students,
two grocers, one was a peddler,
one a tailor, one a lumber trader, one a
merchant and another a butcher.</p>

<p>The peddlers represent an even larger
variety of skilled trades and other occupations.
A jewelry peddler and a rag
peddler were printers; a weaver, two
lumber dealers, a gardener and a grocer
have become peddlers of clothing; a carpenter
sells pictures; two blacksmiths, a
tailor and a farmer are peddling rags.
Of those who were skilled, a goldsmith
has become a presser, a shoemaker is
working at iron beds, an umbrella-maker
runs a pool room and a Hebrew teacher
is now an egg-candler.</p>

<p>In contrast, and much more encouraging,
are the six blacksmiths, eleven tailors,
three barbers, two bakers, three
shoemakers, two printers and a locksmith,
a machinist, a plumber and a glazier,
who started and continue to use the
trades they learned in the old country.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting facts
brought out was that the number of peddlers,
grew from ten in the old country
to twenty-eight on their arrival in America
and to thirty-two as the first work in
Pittsburgh, dropping again to seventeen
who are peddling at the present time.</p>

in the old country with those practiced

<p>The meaning of this table will be made
clearer by telling two stories, one of a
man who is succeeding, and one of a man
who has known the keen anguish that to
the great masses of men is involved in
the words "hard times." For the results
of an industrial depression show themselves
with promptness in such an immigrant
neighborhood. One man, married
and the father of three children, was employed
as a porter in a downtown store.
He was thrown out of work, and to the
terrors of rent was added the fact that
his wife was soon to give birth to another
child. Four weeks afterward, the landlord
levied on the furniture for the unpaid
rent and the weak, under-nourished
mother became temporarily insane. She
was placed in a sanatorium, two of the
children were sent to a day nursery and
the youngest child,&mdash;too young to be taken
by the nursery,&mdash;was sent to a private
family. And then, for the man,
began the struggle to get work. He
bought a small quantity of fruit and peddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
it in a basket from house to house.
He was arrested one morning, in a
freight yard where he was charged by
the yard policeman with stealing. He
was acquitted at the trial and the police
sergeant claimed that cases of injustice
of this kind were not infrequent. Next,
he secured work as janitor in a hospital
at five dollars a week, and after a time,
his wife's condition improved and he was
able to reunite his family. Thereupon,
he borrowed ten dollars and bought a
second-hand pushcart with a license, and
now he is once more trading in fruits
and vegetables in his struggle against
odds to care for them. Another man, forty-eight
years old and the father of eleven
children, had spent his early life in a
small town. His first job on coming to
New York was that of a clothing operator.
The over-strain of the sweatshop
caused the only too frequent breakdown
in health. Two years later he came to
the Pittsburgh District, where, as a peddler
in the country towns, he gradually
regained his strength. To-day, he owns
his home and has a paying grocery business.</p>

<p>Of the 263 non-Jews in these blocks,
nine out of ten were Negroes; and among
them four questionable houses were
found. Such an environment, with the
change from former surroundings and
conditions, does not always work out
satisfactorily; the higher cost of living,
the severe struggle for existence, the sudden
transition from oppression to freedom,
often have a deteriorating influence.
They result in cases of wife-desertion, in
laxity of religious observances, in gambling
sessions at the coffee-houses, in occasional
moral lapses, and in contempt
for the ideals, customs and beauties of
the traditional family and religious life
of the old country. Yet, as a whole, we
know the people of these blocks, and of
the hill, as immigrants who have suffered
oppression and borne ridicule; who in
the face of insult and abuse have remained
silent, but who have stamped on
their countenances a look of stubborn patience
and hope,&mdash;always hope,&mdash;and of
capacity to overcome.</p>

<p>Seven miles from Pittsburgh, up the
valley of the Monongahela River, lie the
town of Homestead and the largest steel
plant in the world. Seventeen years ago,
Homestead was, for a time, the center
of national interest, while the men and
the Carnegie Steel Company fought to
the finish one of the most dramatic battles
in the history of the labor movement.
The men failed,&mdash;public interest died
out,&mdash;but the mill has gone on growing
steadily and the town has kept pace, until
now it numbers about 25,000. Throughout
this time, the corporation, through
its practically unquestioned decisions as
to wages and hours of labor, has in large
measure determined the conditions under
which the men shall live. There is only
one other industry in the town, the
Mesta Machine Company, and little other
work except in providing for the needs
of the mill workers. We may consider
then that the conditions resulting when a
great organized industry creates about it,
without a definite plan, a town dependent
solely upon it for development, are fairly
represented in Homestead. For, after all,
the town is to be considered in part as a
product of the steel industry, as well as
the rails and armor plate shipped in the
great freight trains that puff away down
the river, and the success of the corporation
must be estimated, in part, by its
share in creating the homes and moulding
the lives of the workers.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, two farms occupied
the land now covered by the vast plant
and the homes of hundreds of workers.
In 1881, when Klomans built the mill,
now a part of the United States Steel
Corporation, the change began. The
very aspect of Homestead shows how
during the twenty-seven years that have
passed, the plant has been the unifying
and dominating force in the town. The
mill has now stretched itself for over a
mile along the river and the level space
between the river and a hill rising steeply
behind, which was the original site of
both mill and town, has been entirely shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
off from the water front. The smoke
from the many furnaces and from the
two railroads which cross the town settles
heavily, making the section gloomy even
on the brightest days. Wash day for
some must wait for a west wind, if the
clothes are not to come in blacker than
when they went into the tub, and mothers
find it a problem to keep children even
reasonably clean in a place where the
grass itself is covered with oily dust.</p>

<p>This level space was originally large
enough to accommodate the houses as
well as the mill, but with the growth of
the town, the homes have spread up the
hill, and even out into the region beyond.
For the English speaking people who
were earlier comers, have been glad to
leave the level, smoke-hidden section to
the more recent immigrants. Here, in
houses huddled together, where the totally
inadequate sanitary provisions and
overcrowding are comparable to the
worst sections of a great city, we find
now the homes of the Slavs. Courts
where seventy-five, or even in a few instances
more than a hundred people, are
dependent for water supply on one
hydrant, and houses with an average of
four or five persons to each room are
frequent. These facts will be considered
more in detail in another article, exemplifying
as they do conditions existing in
many small industrial centers.</p>

<p>Though there are no definite figures
available as to the composition of the
population of Homestead, the nationality
of the men employed in the mill in July,
1907, will serve as a clue to the make up
of the town as a whole. Of 6,772 employes,
3,601 or more than half were
Slavs, 1,925 were native whites, 121 colored,
397 English, 259 Irish, 129 Scotch,
176 German, and 164 were of other Europeans.</p>

<p>Aside from the Slavs, there is almost
no tendency among the different nationalities
to live in separate sections. The
more desirable part of the town, which
includes aside from the upper part of
Homestead proper the politically independent
boroughs of West Homestead
and Munhall, is occupied by the whole
English speaking group and it is with
their life that this paper deals.</p>

<p>Parallel to the main thoroughfare,
along the side of the hill, runs street
after street lined with simple frame
houses. These stand detached from one
another, though often with only a passageway
between. There is usually a
porch in front and a small yard where
growing flowers or shrubs give a cheerful
homelike air. The streets are full of
merry children, coasting in winter down
the steep hillsides, or in summer playing
marbles and jumping rope. The
hill lifts this section out of some of
the smoke, but even here the sky is seldom
really bright, and the outlook is over
the stacks of the mills with their plumes
of smoke. In general arrangement, the
town shows an absence of interest in
future development on the part of its
original planners. The avenues, which
run parallel from east to west with alleys
between, are crossed at right angles by
the main streets, cutting the town into
rectangular blocks. Here and there are
beds of old water courses down the hillside,
on whose banks small houses, hardly
more than shanties, have been built. The
narrow lots of the original plan have
had, moreover, a bad effect on the houses
built on them. These houses are small,
usually consisting of four or five rooms,
but the middle room in the latter case
opens only on the passage between the
buildings, which is of necessity very
narrow, and is never reached by sunshine.
Moreover, the narrow lot which
limits decidedly the choice in plans has
resulted in a uniformity of design and a
lack of artistic quality in the houses.
This, especially in winter when there are
no flowers to relieve it, gives to the streets
an air of monotony.</p>

<p>As Homestead grew, houses were built
to the east of it on property outside the
borough limits, owned by the Carnegie
Land Company, a constituent part of the
United States Steel Corporation. This
district and a section including most of
the mill property were formed into the
separate borough of Munhall, said to be
the richest one in Pennsylvania. From
the beginning the mill officials have taken
a marked interest in its development, and
the general effect of Munhall shows the
results. In the center stand side by side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
the imposing library with its little park,
the gift of Mr. Carnegie, and the handsome
residence of the superintendent of
the mill. Behind are the houses of the
minor officials, whose wide lawns are
kept in beautiful condition by men in
the employ of the company. On the
streets farther back, where the employes
live, are many attractive houses, and on
Sixteenth avenue cottages of varying design
set back from the street, show the
possibility of securing effective yet inexpensive
plans.</p>

<p>But neither the presence of the mill
nor the dull sameness of the streets can
hamper the sense of home-likeness which
the workmen feel as they step across
their own doorsteps. The burden of
creating this falls on the shoulders of
the housewife. Usually in these homes
there is that proof of an upward social
trend, a "front room," which with its
comfortable furniture and piano or other
musical instrument is the real center of
the life and amusement of the family.
As one woman said, "The children don't
realize how much it costs to keep up the
parlor, but they want it to look nice so
they can bring their friends in, and as
long as it keeps them home I'll manage
it somehow." And no outsider can understand
the sacrifices involved, the
ceaseless economies if parlor curtains
and pianos are to be evolved from a
wage of fifteen dollars a week.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course extremes of thrift and inefficiency
are met. In one home, where
the man earns but $1.65 a day
and there are six to feed, they
had not only managed to buy an
organ and give one of the girls lessons,
but had saved enough to tide
them through the hard winter of 1908.
But the wife, the daughter of a Pennsylvania
farmer, had learned the thrifty
ways of such a household. For this is
skill amounting to genius and cannot be
expected of all. I remember, in contrast,
a kitchen where all is wretched, the
children unwashed, the woman untidy,
the room unswept. In such a scene, it
is not surprising to have the woman complain
that the man always goes to Pittsburgh
with a crowd to spend the evening.
Though he earns nearly twice what the
other man does, his wife, who had been
trained as a servant in a wealthy home
and had learned extravagant ways, realized
in a helpless sort of way her inability
to "get caught up" financially, or to display
any efficiency in managing her home
and training her children. Between these
two types is that of the average family,

</div>

<p>The recognition among the people of
the value of home life, finds perhaps no
more striking proof than the zeal shown
by many of them in purchasing their
houses. According to the census figures
of 1900, 567 families owned homes in the
borough, 27.3 per cent of the entire number
of houses, and 268 of these were free
from encumbrance. Such business
organizations as the Homestead Realty
Company have met the needs of
those wishing to buy on a slender
income by a system of selling
on the instalment plan, which in large
measure takes the place of building and
loan associations. The initial payment
is small, sometimes as low as $150 for
a house of four rooms, the real estate
company assumes the obligations for insurance,
taxes, and interest on the mortgage,
and the buyer pays a monthly
instalment large enough to cover all this
and make a small reduction on the principal.
For example, one family I know
bought a four-room house worth about
$1,750. Of this, they paid down $150,
and thereafter a monthly instalment of
sixteen dollars, which was little more
than they would have had to pay for
rent. Though it has taken fifteen years
to buy the house, they now have a home
of their own; and without unreasonable
sacrifice.</p>

<p>No phase of this attitude towards saving
was to me more interesting than the
reasons given for and against buying.
Two sisters were typical of these different
opinions. One with six children,
whose husband made something over
three dollars a day, said: "I didn't try
to buy, because I wanted to give my
children everything that was coming to
them, and I wouldn't stint them." So,
as far as she could, she had given them
what the other children in school had,
and truly three dollars goes but a little
way in a town where the rent is four dollars
a room and food-stuffs are said to
be the highest in the country. The other,
wiser perhaps, had begun early to buy
her home. Though she has been married
only five years, to a man whose income
is about the same as the brother-in-law,
and there are two little ones to care for,
they have already made the initial payment
on their home. It is a neat five-room
house on one of the good streets,
with running water in the kitchen and a
bath-room, and is worth about $3,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
Of this they paid $300 down, and their
monthly instalment is twenty-five dollars.
Since their family is small, by subletting
two rooms for eight dollars a
month, they reduce the monthly expenditure
to about an ordinary rent. While
it will take some years to pay off the indebtedness,
by the time that the children
are large enough to need the other rooms,
they plan to be well on their way toward
accomplishing this.</p>

<p>With many, however, the initial purchase
is only the beginning of their
home making, and, as soon as the house
is paid for, the family take the most
genuine pleasure in its improvement.
Sometimes it is the addition of a bath-room;
sometimes it is the repapering
which the busy mother finds time to do
in the spring; sometimes the building of
a wash-house in the yard. But wherever
such improvements are made it means always
the development of the sense of
family life and its common interests.</p>

<p>In home buying there lurks, of course,
an undeniable danger to the workman:
the danger of putting all his savings into
a house, when death, discharge, or a season
of hard times may mean the necessity
of a forced sale with its inevitable loss.
That the owning of a home tends to lessen
the mobility of labor is a factor to be
considered in upholding it as a desirable
form of thrift. In Homestead, however,
this danger has been minimized by what
has otherwise been a disadvantage to the
town, the lack of a sufficient number of
houses.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Buildings have not been erected
fast enough to keep pace with the town's
growth, and consequently rents have
risen and desirable houses are hard to
secure. This situation, while it stimulates
people to buy their own homes, also
makes it possible to sell at almost any
time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> During the depression of 1907-8 there was an
abundance of houses, as families were doubling up
to save rent, but this was only a temporary situation.</p></div>

<p>There are many, however, to whom
these real homes are not possible. There
rises to my mind, in contrast, a two-room
tenement down in the grimy corner
where the mill joins the town. Here a
woman was trying to support four little
children by sewing and washing. Her
husband had died after eight years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>semi-invalidism resulting from an accident
in the mill. With his small wages
they had not been able to save, and as
the injury had occurred so long ago, she
was not eligible for a benefit from the
Carnegie Relief Fund. The kitchen was
small and hot and the younger children
noisy, and the not unnatural consequence
was that the oldest girl drifted to the
streets, mixed with a gay crowd, and
eventually became a charge of the
Juvenile Court. The girl was not bad
at heart, and had there been a cheerful
home where her friends could come, the
end might have been different.</p>

</div>

<p>This instance illustrates the fact, more
or less true of the whole town, that local
conditions are such as to lay too large
a responsibility for providing enjoyment
on the skill of the wife and mother.
Where she succeeds, the home becomes
the center of the family's happiness, yet
even so, we should look to the town itself
for those wider opportunities for mental
and physical relaxation which help maintain
a normal life. But to the stranger
approaching Homestead, the town speaks
more eloquently of toil than of pleasure.
The river, elsewhere so often a source
of endless enjoyment,
is muddy
and swift.
Moreover, one
bank is preempted
by the
railroad, the
other by the
long and unsightly
stretches
of mill yard. In
the second
ward, near the
river, which is
almost solidly
built up, the only
place for the
children to play
is the street or
the alley. That
the boys do not
find these a
wholly satisfactory
playground
is shown by the
following clipping
from the local newspaper:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="ph4 smcap">Boys Claim Their Rights Are Being Interfered
With.</div>

<p>The boys of Homestead want to know
why they cannot play basketball on the
street, and they want to know what they can
do. Burgess please answer in Monday's <i>Messenger</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the top of the hill there are open
places where the bigger boys find room
for recreation, but it is a long climb, too
long for the small children in the section
where a place for play is most needed.</p>

<p>The two recreation parks within a five-cent
fare of the town, owned by the street
railway, are the scenes of many school
and church picnics and lodge gatherings.
Here the young people find the skating
rinks and dancing pavilions and the shrill
music of the merry-go-rounds, while
tired mothers seek quiet grass plots
where they may sit and watch the children
play, and where they may have the
rare chance to gossip with their neighbors.</p>

<p>In Homestead itself the two popular
forms of amusement are the skating rink
and the nickelodeon. The former fills the
papers with advertisements for moonlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
skating parties,
a "marriage on
rollers," and
other devices for
attracting patronage.
The
gaiety and swing
of this pastime,
which appeal to
the young and
vigorous, have
made it in general
very popular.
It offers,
however, those
dangers common
to the indiscriminate
meeting
of young
people, which
make some
mothers hesitate
to let their girls
go unless with
"our own
crowd."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BACK YARD POSSIBILITIES IN HOMESTEAD&mdash;II.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The nickelodeon, whose small cost
brings it within the financial reach of
most families, is perhaps the most popular
entertainment. You are admitted to
a room the size of a small store, with
rows of chairs, a small stage, and an
atmosphere that is soon unbearably close.
Here you witness for five cents a show
lasting about fifteen minutes. On the
Saturday afternoon when I attended,
there was a series of moving pictures
illustrating a story on the same theme
as Camille, and two sentimental songs
illustrated by colored slides. While none
of them was of a high grade of amusement
they evidently really entertained
the audience, at least half of whom were
workingmen. To them the nickelodeon
seems to make a special appeal since it
offers the variety they crave after long
days in the mill. This limited range of
amusement offered is almost the only
entertainment which is available for older
people, or which can be enjoyed in common
by them and by the young and active
members of the community. While this
lack is met, in a degree, by the entertainments
which lodges and churches
give, the latter are rather sedate. The
festivities which appeal to young people
are all money-making enterprises, with
the abuses likely to result under such conditions.
Many of the clergymen expressed
their belief that there was need of a better
kind of amusement, a need which
might be met by such institutions as the
public recreation centers of Chicago.</p>

<p>Among the causes contributing to this
lack of amusement is the possibility for
those with more money and leisure of
securing the better class of entertainment
in Pittsburgh. Still as it is a forty-five
minutes' ride to the city, mothers tied
down by the care of children, and men
wearied by the day's work seldom avail
themselves of what Pittsburgh offers.
Another cause is found in the fact that the
owners of the mill are non-residents, and
give neither money nor influence to help
the everyday normal development of the
town. There is a marked contrast in
this between Homestead's situation and
that of independent towns of similar size.
In the latter, where there is a larger proportion
of the well-to-do who are dependent
for entertainment on what the
town offers, it is possible to secure fairly
good theatrical performances, as well as
concerts and lectures.</p>

</div>

<p>Two additions to the opportunities for
relaxation have, however, been made by
prominent officials of the steel corporation.
At the Carnegie Library there is
a club providing classes for musical
training which give occasional concerts,
as well as a gymnasium with a swimming
pool, bowling alleys, etc. This club,
which is open to all on payment of two
dollars a year, is popular with the young
men, especially those on the clerical force.
A series of entertainments, however,
given during the winter of 1907-8 under
the management of a lecture bureau was
not successful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 681px;">
<img src="images/fig144b.jpg" width="681" height="681" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A NICKELODEON AUDIENCE IN HOMESTEAD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The second, the gift from Mr. Frick
of a small formal park transformed from
an ugly hole at the end of one of the
ravines, is the source of much pride to
the town. A need which it does not supply,
however, was shown by a visit there
one hot afternoon. Three or four men
were sitting in the sun on the benches set
along the cement paths. The grass had
recently been cut and in a pile which
lay on the edge of the street, half a dozen
little chaps were turning somersaults and
revelling in the coolness. For them, the
park with its set flower beds and well-kept
lawn offered few inducements. They
would prefer a real playground.</p>

<p>The chief obstacle to the development
of amusements is, doubtless, the hours
and nature of mill work. Every other
week the men work on night turn. Then
they get home early in the morning and
are ready, right after breakfast, for the
much needed sleep; at four o'clock in the
afternoon they must be called, and after
an early supper they are off to the mill
for the long night. That week there is
no chance for outside festivities, nor
chance even for the family to have
quiet evenings together. Sometimes when
sons who are also in the mill are on the
opposite shift, the family is not able to
meet even for meals. This irregularity
not only tends to break into the family
life, but also by making regular engagements
impossible, lessens the interest in
outside things. Even when the men are
on day turn and are through work at
half-past five, the ten hours of heavy
labor in the mill leave them little ambition
to seek out amusements. The exhausting
nature of the work, coupled
with the lack of sleep due to this constant
change of habits, makes them weary
enough, as they show by the slow steps
and bent shoulders of the homeward procession.
Change of thought and genuine
relaxation are nevertheless a necessity,
if the men are to maintain even mere
physical efficiency.</p>

<p>The spirit of the mill is the spirit of
work. We have found that the town itself
provides for the men little opportunity
for genuine relaxation after the strain of
the day's work; and when we turn to the
town again, seeking whether it offers any
stimulus to mental activity, we find in it
the same failure to help in the development
of a normal life. There is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
Carnegie Library to be sure, which has
classes in metallurgy, and provides expensive
periodicals dealing with the steel
trade as well as general reading matter.
But as many a man said to me, "Oh
what's the use of a library when a man
works twelve hours a day?"</p>

<p>Although efforts towards a reorganization
of the union are practically at an
end, because of the opposition of the mill
officials, there is earnest thinking going
on among some of the men about the
great corporation which controls wages
and hours, and so much of the rest of life
as is dependent upon them. One man,
who during the recent hard times was
not earning enough to pay his rent, said,
"I don't blame the superintendent here
for our being out of work, but the men
in New York could help it, only they
don't know or don't care what a cut in
wages means to us."</p>

<p>That the changes in wage scale or the
decisions to work but half time last
winter, which came to them without explanation,
were related to an industrial
depression which affected a whole continent,
was but dimly understood. They
knew of dividends, and they knew of
wage-cuts. With the feeling that they
are impotent to change conditions, some
of the more thoughtful men are turning
to socialism for the larger solution
it seems to offer. I was surprised to hear
socialism advocated by the wife of a mill
clerk making two dollars a day. She
and her husband were thrifty people who
had just succeeded in buying a piece of
property,&mdash;not at all the typical socialists
of a conservative man's fears. But in
their twenty years of married life, the
clerk's wages had been cut fifteen per
cent. With a growing family, needs had
increased, and only stringent economies,
the cutting out even of five cents for the
nickelodeon, had made their home what
it was. And now with mills idle and
their little savings rapidly going, a sense
of social injustice was making itself felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span></p>

<p>This picture grimly sums up Homestead&mdash;the mill at the left, the Carnegie library on the hill in the center,
and the mean houses of the second ward to the right.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Recently considerable agitation in regard
to the subject was aroused by the
preaching of a minister, who is a Christian-socialist.
While many of the men
were keenly interested in his theories,
there was so much opposition among the
conservative members of the congregation,
that finally he was obliged to leave.
I was told that in one of the first committee
meetings to discuss the situation,
his position was approved by the workingmen
members, while opposition was
expressed by two men who served corporations
in a professional capacity.</p>

<p>Again, a Scotchman, feeling the capitalist's
lack of sympathy for the working
man's problems, expressed surprise that
a number of wealthy Scotchmen had
joined in the celebration of Burns's
birthday. "How can they," he said,
"when they think of his social theories?
I should think they would be ashamed
to." To him, Burns was the man who
wrote A Man's a Man for A' That.</p>

<p>But men such as these are the exceptions.
One of the most intelligent men
I know, an ardent socialist, told me of his
exasperation because his fellows were, he
held, so unintelligent and were so unwilling
to talk about social questions. This
he thought was due to the long hours
and hard work, since it took the other
twelve hours to rest from the day's labor.
Most of them, truly, are both too tired
to think and too conscious of the dominance
of the corporation to believe it
worth while to seek a solution of these
problems. Neither is there much within
the mill to develop intellectual keenness.
The men, it is true, are encouraged to
invent improvements, but though these
undoubtedly influence their promotion it
is currently reported that the men receive
no direct reward. The general feeling,
moreover, that promotion is due to favoritism,
lessens the stimulus to study and
work up. With the attitude of the mill
officials toward trade unionism, men are
more or less afraid to discuss industrial
questions with one another. An old resident
gave me this as a current maxim,</p>

<p>"If you want to talk in Homestead you
must talk to yourself."</p>

<p>In one respect, however, the men do
unite to meet conditions arising under the
industry. The work in the mills brings
them constantly face to face with the
danger of accident. Almost daily, occur
minor accidents: a foot bruised by a
heavy weight, a hand lacerated by a machine;
accidents not serious enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
prevent work for any length of time,
or perhaps to justify damages. But
where the margin is small, two weeks or
even one of enforced idleness means a
serious problem in family finances. While
the men injured are eligible to the Carnegie
Relief Fund, this fund gives assistance
only when a man has been disabled
for a year or more, and consequently is
of no help in minor accidents. In order
to meet these emergencies, then, the men
have utilized the fraternal orders which
form one of the chief centers of interest
in Homestead life. There are more than
forty lodges, and while it was impossible
to learn the exact membership, twenty-three
lodges report a total membership
of 3,663, of whom 3,400 are men. The
strongest of these is the Odd Fellows,
with a membership of over 1,000, most of
whom are steel workers. In all but two
out of twenty-seven, concerning which
data were secured, there are benefit features;
a sick benefit usually of five dollars
a week for three months with a
smaller sum thereafter; and a small death
benefit of only $150 or so. The fraternal
insurance orders, which vary the assessments
with the amount of the benefit,
give as high as $5,000. Sometimes both
regular and lodge insurance policies are
carried. In sixty-three families investigated,
only nine of the heads of families
were uninsured, while eighteen carried
both kinds. What this insurance means,
however, is but feebly shown by the
amounts involved. One woman, speaking
of her early struggles, told how in
the first year of her married life, her husband
was seriously burned in the mill and
for three months was unable to do a
stroke of work. Fortunately, from the
three benefit orders to which he belonged
came $12.50 a week, which supported the
family. "My baby came then," she added
feelingly, "and if it had not been for that
money, I could have bought no clothes
for her."</p>

<p>In addition to this benefit feature, the
lodge offers an opportunity for the development
of sympathy and the consciousness
of social solidarity. A woman, who
was a rather recent comer to Homestead,
had been a member of one of these
lodges in another town. Her little baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
became ill and died, and where otherwise
she would have been alone in her grief,
her fellow members came at once to
watch with her during his sickness, and
to console her after his death. "Why,
they were like my own sisters," she said,
and it was this which counted rather than
the twenty-five dollars which helped meet
the funeral expenses.</p>

<p>The lodge also affords an opportunity
to show that interest in outside matters,
which otherwise finds scanty means of
expression. I saw one day a half bushel
of fine potatoes ready for baking, which
a woman told me were her contribution
to a supper being given for an emergency
hospital in Homestead. "We don't need
that hospital," she said, "because my man
isn't in a dangerous place in the mill,
but I'm glad to help even if most of them
are 'Hunkies.'" During the winter of
1907-8, almost every lodge in town gave
some sort of entertainment for the benefit
of this hospital. Aroused by the suffering
of men seriously injured in the mill,
who have to be taken on the train to
Pittsburgh, the whole town united in a
determination to meet this need of their
community. While the individual contributions
of the workingmen would have
been discouragingly small, their real interest
could express itself through the
existing lodge organizations. In fact,
aside from the church, the lodge seems to
offer the one possibility of co-operative
effort.</p>

<p>Many men also find here their one
chance of meeting other men socially.
All the lodges, even the purely insurance
ones, have social features, and often at
special meetings the whole family go together.
While these features of fraternal
orders are of course common in
all communities, in Homestead, with its
danger of accident and its limitation as
to other amusements, they play an especially
important role.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet life needs some outlook for the
future other than preparation to meet
its disasters. With the increase in the
size of the corporation, the days are
passing when a rise to a position of
eminence is possible for a poor boy, so
that personal ambition has become a negative
factor. But to the parents who seek
for their children a better position, more
education and more of the refinements
of life, the future is full of interest. One
woman complained that her neighbor
was "all right, only she talks too much
about her children," but when one
realized how much the mother's interest
and devotion had done to
make her sons successful, it was
easy to forgive her. Another woman,
of natural sweetness and grace of manner,
told of her efforts to teach her little
girls those formal niceties in which she
had not been trained. "I bought a book
on manners," she said, "so as to teach the
children, and I make myself do the things
so they will. It's awfully hard to say
'excuse me' when I leave the table, but if
I don't they'll never learn," and the greeting
given a stranger by the little daughter
showed how well this mother was succeeding.</p>

<p>The center of interest, especially to the
fathers, is in the future of their sons.
Often the sons go ahead of their fathers
in the race, and one elderly man told me
with pride that he owed his easy job to
his son who had become an assistant
superintendent. Sometimes parents, most
frequently the mothers, are unwilling that
their boys should enter the mill, for the
fear of accident makes the long nights a
time of terror. Many a woman has said,
"When I was first married, I couldn't
sleep when the 'mister' was on night turn,
but, of course, I'm used to it now." Still
when their sons grow up, they begin
again to dread the danger. The great
mill, however, has a fascination of its
own, so that most of the boys "follow the
stacks." They then live at home, contributing
their share to the family income,
and we find that economic bond which
Mrs. Bosenquet has pointed out as so
dominant a factor in strengthening family
life in England. This mutual affection
is undoubtedly the most potential factor
in keeping pure the moral life of the town.</p>

<p>Morally the town is an average one.
Along one of the railroads is a section
comparable in a small way to some of the
dark parts of a great city, and there
gambling, immorality and drunkenness
have their meeting place, but in the districts
where most of the workmen have
their homes, the former two evils are
practically unknown. A doctor in a position
to know the situation well, believes
that in the main this town is clean
morally, and his statement is confirmed
by clergymen and other physicians.</p>

<p>Intemperance, on the other hand, is a
serious factor. In Munhall there are no
saloons, but in Homestead, there are fifty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
eight in a single block on Eighth avenue
next to the mill entrance. As one resident
summed up the situation, "I think
we have at least sixty-five saloons, ten
wholesale liquor stores, a number of beer
agents, innumerable speak-easies and a
dozen or more drug stores,"&mdash;and this in
a town of 25,000. In addition to their
usual attractions of light and jollity, the
saloons appeal to the thirst engendered
by hours of work in the heat. Though
this heat-thirst is frequently offered
as an excuse for drinking, men who
do not drink are emphatic in their
belief that alcohol lessens their
ability to withstand the extreme temperature.
While intoxication is not
very frequent, the saloons do a thriving
business and their patrons were
among the first to feel the hardships of
the industrial depression. A clergyman
assured me that preaching against intemperance
did no good and that substitutes
must be offered, but so far none
has been developed. The library, which
is on the hill out of the men's way, cannot
be reckoned as a counter attraction,
for they are too tired to be often tempted
by it.</p>

<p>The church, too, finds it hard to hold
them. The fact that they usually have to
work either Saturday night or Sunday
night, and some men during Sunday as
well, affects the attitude of the whole
town towards Sunday keeping. A clergyman
who complained because a certain
store was open on Sunday, was told that
as the mill ran that day, nothing could
be done about closing the store. "We
can't take the little fish and let the big
one go." The men feel the inconsistency
in being urged to attend church when
they have to work hard part of the day.
Then too, they are often very tired. One
big, jovial colored man told me how he
came home Sunday morning from the
mill expecting to go to church, but fell
fast asleep while waiting for the hour of
service.</p>

<p>The churches, however, play an important
part in the life of those, especially
the women and young people, who
are actually connected with them. The
thirty churches represent all denominations,
some of them preserving their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
original race distinctions.
Two
Welsh churches
still have their
service in the
Keltic language.
There are a
number of missions,
among
them one on the
main street,
whose transparency
bearing the
legend, "The
Wages of Sin Is
Death," suggests
a Bowery type.
The Salvation
Army, while it has a short muster
roll, has a strong grip on the community
which seems impressed by its earnestness,
simplicity and poverty. For
whatever its intellectual limitations there
is throughout the town a profound respect
for genuine spiritual devotion.
During the winter most of the churches,
in addition to their regular weekly services,
held special revival meetings.
These, while they have little of the tense
excitement sometimes associated with
such meetings, seem to be a strong force
in developing the real spiritual power of
the churches.</p>

<p>The church, moreover, meets certain
of the social needs of the town through
its wholesome festivities. All winter the
stores were full of signs of "chicken and
waffle suppers," and the papers told of
socials of all the varieties that a small
church evolves. These were usually to
raise funds, sometimes for church expenses,
sometimes for charity, and in one
instance, I remember, to help send out a
foreign missionary. But, whatever the
object, they serve to increase the happiness
of life under wholesome conditions.</p>

</div>

<p>So the church plays its part, both spiritually
and socially, in helping its members
to a fuller individual life. It does
not, however, furnish an opportunity for
that discussion of matters of everyday
concern to the men, which might serve
to arouse their interest in the whole life
of the church and to quicken their sense
of civic responsibility. Moreover, in a
town where industrial questions are of
paramount importance, the church is only
beginning to take an interest in them.
In the larger question of leadership in
civic life, the churches seem also to have
missed a great opportunity. Though
they took some action in the local option
campaign, this was an isolated instance,
and in general they do not appear to have
accepted their full responsibility in
arousing men to a realization of the
duties of citizenship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span></p>

<p>That a sense of civic responsibility is
needed, is emphasized by those who
know the life of the town, and who find
there a serious political situation. In
Homestead, which is by far the largest
and most important of the three boroughs,
the political conditions are worst.
The borough government consists of a
burgess elected every three years, and a
council, which is also elective. Of the
two important committees, the Board of
Health is appointed by the burgess with
the consent of the council, and the School
Board is chosen directly by the people.</p>

<p>In spite of the possibility of influencing
some of the local conditions through these
elected representatives, there is general
indifference in regard to local politics.
In one matter where their direct family
interests are concerned, the people have
demanded and received an efficient administration.
They are proud of their
schools and the personnel of the School
Board, and certainly this is the best service
given to the people of the town. But
while the men all agree that the situation
is dominated by the wholesale liquor interests,
schemes for political reform
arouse little enthusiasm. In spite of
years of casual agitation against inadequately
guarded railroad crossings, it
was not till the summer of 1908 that any
effective protest was made. People still
pay a neighbor fifty cents a month for
the privilege of getting good water from
his well, instead of insisting that it be
provided by the borough. A river, polluted
by the sewage of many towns above
it, and by chemicals from the mills strong
enough to kill all the fish, furnishes the
drinking water for the town.</p>

<p>To a certain extent at least, mental
sluggishness due, as we have seen, to the
conditions under which men work, is at
the root of their indifference. It is, of
course, true that the mill is not the source
of all the undesirable conditions in Homestead.
Many of the disadvantages of the
town are similar to those of other suburban
and industrial centers that are less
definitely influenced by a great industry.
But for a large part of the evil the mill
must be considered responsible. There
was its influence, for example, in making
Munhall into a separate borough, thus
securing a lower tax for its plant and
real estate and by that much adding to
the burdens of the majority of its working
people. For in Homestead, the mill
owns little property. In Munhall, the tax
rate is eight and one-half mills and the
mill pays $40,000 a year in taxes, while
in Homestead, where the larger part of
the workers live, the tax rate is fifteen
mills and the mill pays a tax of but
$7,000.</p>

<p>The mill has, moreover, done nothing
to give the town an effective leadership,
the most striking need of the situation.
On the one hand by the destruction of the
union it has removed the one force by
which workingmen could have been
trained for leadership; on the other hand,
since its owners are scattered throughout
the country, it has not supplied such
a group of educated men with free time
and public interest as have been the
strong influences in developing normal
communities. When I asked, in discussing
the sanitary condition of the Slavic
courts, if anything could be done to improve
the situation I was assured that
only a man of strong local influence could
accomplish such a reform; but no one
could suggest the man.</p>

<p>In contrast then to the wonderful development
of the industry itself, with its
splendid organization, its capable management,
its efficient methods, we find a
town which lacks sound political organization,
which lacks true leadership,
which lacks the physical and moral efficiency
which can come only through
leisure to think and to enjoy. The only
genuine interest we find centers about
the individual home life, and, in spite of
outward physical disadvantages, the hindrance
of inadequate income, the lack
of proper training in household economics,
and the limited outlook which the
town affords, the men and the women are
creating real homes. That many fail
against these odds is not surprising.
"Life, work, and happiness, these three
are bound together." The mill offers the
second, indifferent whether it is under
conditions that make the other two possible.</p>

of the American Civic Association and the National
Municipal League, Pittsburgh, Nov. 16, outlining
some of the findings of the Pittsburgh Survey
and drawing upon data secured in various
fields of investigation.</p></div>

<p>It was my good fortune to spend a
week the past summer in Essen and other
industrial towns of the Rhenish-Westphalia
district of Germany, following
something over a year spent in the Pittsburgh
district. I fancy that in our attitude
toward the old countries, we are
inclined to regard their cities as long established
and to find justification for any
lapses of our own in the newness of
America. But Essen, for instance, as an
industrial center is new. The chronology
of the development of the steel industry
there is not altogether different from that
of the same industry in Pittsburgh; and
one of the great problems of Fried. Krupp
was to mobilize and hold within reach of
his furnaces and rolls a large and efficient
working population. Entering the industrial
field generations later than England,
German manufacturers have not
had a trained working force ready to
hand. Krupp had to draw his men from
the country districts,&mdash;healthy, unskilled
peasants, unused to the quick handling of
their muscles, unused to working indoors,
unused to machinery, unused to living in
large communities. The wages offered,
as against the wages of agricultural districts,
drew them there; he must keep
them there out of reach of his competitors,
and he must see that they worked at
the top notch of their efficiency. It was
a loss to Herr Krupp when a man with
five years' training in his works left Essen,
or was sick, or was maimed.</p>

<p>As a town, Essen was unprepared to
absorb this great new industrial population.
There were not houses enough;
the newcomers were sheltered abominably
and charged exorbitant rents by the local
landlords. There weren't food supplies
enough within reach of the growing city,
and the workers had to buy poor bread
and bad meat, and to pay heavily for
them. The town had not enough sanitary
appliances to dispose of the waste
which a congregation of individuals
sloughs off and which, if not
properly disposed of, breeds disease.
The rents and high provisions pared
away most of the incentive in the
wages which must attract this working
force to Essen; poor houses and poor
food made directly for stupid, half-roused
workers and for poor work. Primarily as
a business proposition, then, Herr Krupp
started that group of social institutions
which have since been expanded from
one motive or another, until they supply
an infinite variety of wants to the Essen
workers. The firm bought up successive
plots of land, laid them out, sewered
them, parked them, and to-day, at the end
of fifty years, over thirty thousand persons
are living in houses belonging to the
Essen works (ten thousand of the sixty
thousand Krupp employes are thus supplied).
There has been a growth in quality
as well as in numbers of houses. The
buildings of the first workmen's colony,
West End, are rough, crude boxes; the
new colonies of Alfredshof and Friedrichshof
are beautiful, with their red
roofs, graceful lines, lawns, housekeeping
conveniences and modest rents.
Not less than seventy-seven Krupp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
supply stores, operated on a profit-sharing
basis, sell meat, bread, manufactured
goods and household furniture.
One of the greatest bakeries
in Germany is operated on a cost
basis, and there are slaughter houses,
flour mills, ice making establishments,
tailor shops, etc. Hospitals, convalescent
homes, pensions, and invalidity and
accident funds have been instituted, and
have since been fortified and expanded
under the imperial scheme of industrial
insurance, which governs throughout
Germany.</p>

<p>This welfare work of the Krupps has
not succeeded in keeping either trade unionism
or socialism out of the ranks of
the working force; it has tended to put
the workers in a position of semi-feudal
dependence for comforts and to sap their
initiative; and in those bearings it is not
in accord with American ideas; but it has
served to gather at Essen, to keep there,
and to keep there at a high standard of
working efficiency, one of the most remarkable
labor forces in Germany.</p>

<p>It is solely the latter aspect of the case
that concerns us here. I think it is
agreed that when it comes to armor plate,
I-beams, tubes, or rails, the Pittsburgh
steel plants can beat the world. But a
week's stay among the Krupp colonies
at Essen brings with it the conviction
that we in America have considerable
distance to go if we are to match the Germans
in the science of improved community
conditions. The question is how
some of these higher standards can be
worked out in an American industrial
district where one corporation does not
dominate; where you are dealing with a
much greater aggregation of people
spread over a much greater territory, and
where you must work out your solution
in democratic ways through democratic
agencies.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that much
that I say of Pittsburgh is true of practically
all our industrial centers; our severest
criticism of any one comes not from
a comparison with its fellows, but from
a comparison of the haphazard development
of its social institutions with the
splendid organic development of its industrial
enterprises. And more, in the
methods and scope of progressive business
organizations we have some of the
most suggestive clues as to ways for municipal
progress.</p>

<p>My first point has to do with administrative
areas. The most effective city
administration cannot act to advantage
unless the units through which it operates
are workable and bear some relation to
the function they are designed to perform.
The radius of the old time city,
as one English writer has pointed out,
was the distance you could walk from
your work in the center to a home convenient
in the outskirts. To-day, for
most purposes, a city is a rapid transit
proposition. For most purposes, a municipal
area can be governed most effectively
if it includes all such districts as
can be reached by city workers, by subway,
steam, or surface lines. The movement
for a greater Pittsburgh, which,
within the last year, has been advanced
by the merging of Allegheny and the
movement for a greater Birmingham,
which is now in progress in the corresponding
English industrial center, are
recognitions of this fact. The police,
fire,&mdash;in fact, every department of municipal
activity is cramped and rendered
less effective by restricted bounds.</p>

<p>But for certain functional activities
much wider areas must be covered. The
sanitary inspection force of Cleveland,
for instance, inspects dairies and slaughter-houses
throughout all that part of
Ohio that supplies the Cleveland market;
in contrast with the Pittsburgh inspection
service which is at present able to inspect
supplies only as they come into the city
and sources in the immediate neighborhood.
Again, the sewer and water problem
of Pittsburgh is a water-shed problem.
One hundred and twenty-nine towns
and boroughs are dumping their sewage
into the rivers which run past Pittsburgh
and from which Pittsburgh must draw its
water. No one of these governmental
units can work out its sanitary problem
alone. Close co-ordination of sanitary
work is needed throughout the whole
river district.</p>

<p>There is necessity, then, for increasing
our municipal administrative areas and
for relating them to the functions which
must be performed through them; and
this very fact raises the distinctive civic
problem of creating this enlarged municipal
machinery, without sacrificing that local
loyalty and interest which in neighborhoods
and smaller districts make for good
government. In Pittsburgh we have a
central city,&mdash;a market and office center
with groups of outlying mill towns and
half-agricultural districts between. The
opponents of city congestion would break
up all our big urban centers into such an
open work structure; and if the citizenship
of the Pittsburgh steel district can
work out effective methods of government
and high standards of community
well-being for this ganglion of working
communities, it will have made an original
contribution to municipal science.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But let us look more carefully at this
question of area as applied to the functioning
of particular social institutions.
We have the theory in America, for instance,
that common school education
should be supplied by the public, and to
this end, besides state subsidies and other
revenues, a general millage is laid on all
taxable property in Pittsburgh for the
salaries of teachers and for other general
expenses. But the actual operation of
the schools continues on an old vestry system
of ward control,&mdash;a system given up
by Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Baltimore
and other cities of Pittsburgh's class, because
the ward has proved an ineffective
administrative unit. Let us see how it
works in Pittsburgh. Each ward lays
and collects a tax on property within its
limits for the erection and maintenance
of school buildings. Thus, ward two in
the business district, with a total of only
363 pupils, can draw on property with an
assessed valuation of $37,491,708; while
ward fourteen, with 2,423 children, can
draw on property worth $34,264,077 (less
taxable property and seven times as many
children); while ward thirty-one has
1,173 children and only $3,074,085 in assessed
property (or three times as many
children as ward two and not one-tenth
the taxable property). No wonder, then,
that the valuation of school buildings and
equipment ranges from approximately
$41 per school child in the thirty-first
ward to $1,033 per school child in the
second; and the income for maintenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
of buildings, etc., from $6 per school
child in the thirty-fifth ward to $84 per
school child in the first. No wonder,
then, that in these ward-school buildings
and their equipment there is the utmost
divergence. Our investigators found
buildings every room of which was overcrowded,
with children sitting on benches,
with chairs in the aisles; wards in
which basement rooms were thrown into
commission without adequate heat, light,
desks or ventilation; schools unconnected
with the sewer; schools without fireproofing,
without fire escapes, without
fire drills;&mdash;all these in contrast to progressive
schools in other wards with first-rate
equipment, small classes, good
plumbing and adequate light. Wards
which have the most children, whose
children have the least cultural environment
and stimulus at home, have, many
of them, the least resources to tax for
school purposes. By an out-worn system
of ward control and taxation, then,
the teaching force of Pittsburgh is supplied
in districts where the work is hardest
with schoolhouses and other tools
which are least effective. Some districts
have schools which in equipment and
spirit rank with any in the country;
while in some the school plants ought to
be scrapped offhand.</p>

<p>Turn to another social institution,&mdash;the
hospitals. We may conceive that the first
service of hospitals is to be accessible to
the sick and injured, and that an adequate
hospital system should be at all times
quickly available to the people who may
have use for it. We may compare it with
the efficiency of the telephone company
which, through sub-exchanges, centrals
and private connections, effectively reaches
every district. How stands the case
with the hospitals of Pittsburgh? The
city is served by a group of private institutions,
many of them adequately equipped
and progressively managed; but
there is no system of co-ordination between
them, either in the operation of
their free wards or in the maintenance of
an effective ambulance service. New
hospitals are erected under the eaves of
old hospitals. Sick and injured people
are carried long, unnecessary distances at
great risk. Seven new hospitals are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
up in Pittsburgh and yet, when they
are all completed and other changes
which have been decided upon are carried
out, there will be a great belt of
river wards, thickly populated, without a
convenient hospital plant,&mdash;wards in
which we shall see disease is most rife.
This failure of a co-ordination of hospital
work in Pittsburgh is appreciated
by a number of the most progressive superintendents,
and no one would welcome
more than they a movement to interlock
the hospital service of the city in some
effective way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another point of contrast between
Pittsburgh, the industrial center, and
Pittsburgh, the community, lies in the
progressiveness and invention which have
gone into the details of one and the other;
for instance, aldermen's courts which
dispense justice to the working population
of Pittsburgh and deal with the
minor civil business of a city of half a
million. They serve very well in an agricultural
district. They are of the vintage
of the village blacksmith. But with
the exception of a few well conducted
courts, the forty or more ward courts
may be said to clutter up and befog the
course of minor justice, and to be an exasperation
in the conduct of civil business.
They add to rather than subtract
from the business of the higher courts,
and there is no effective supervision of
their operation. They compare with the
new municipal courts of Chicago about
as the open forges of King John's time
compare with a Bessemer converter.</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;Pittsburgh is the second city
in Pennsylvania in point of population;
in some respects it is the center of the
most marvelous industrial district in the
world. Thousands of men and women
are engaged in hundreds of processes.
But the state factory inspection department
has not so much as an office in this
city. There are inspectors, but they are
not easily get-at-able for the workingman
who may be laboring under unsanitary
conditions or with unprotected machinery,
or for the citizen who may know of
violations of the factory acts which he
conceives it his duty to report. My conception
of an adequate labor department
office in Pittsburgh is more than that of
an industrial detective bureau. My conception
is rather that of a headquarters,
with an adequate force of technical experts
and physicians who would be constantly
studying the work processes of
the district with the idea of eliminating
wherever possible, those conditions which
make for disease; with laboratory facilities
for experiment and demonstration of
protective devices calculated to reduce accidents;
drawing, to this end, upon the
industrial experience of the whole world.
The factory inspector's office in Birmingham,
for instance, is in close co-operation
with courts, with employers and with
workmen. Within three years, its suggestions
have reduced the number of
deaths due to one variety of crane from
twenty-one to three.</p>

<p>The old time city built a wall about it.
That kept out invaders. The invaders
of a modern city are infectious diseases.
In the development of sanitary service
and bureaus of health of wide powers and
unquestioned integrity, the modern city
is erecting its most effective wall. In
Pittsburgh, the health authority is still a
subordinate bureau without control over
appointments under the civil service, and
without that final authority which should
go with its supreme responsibility toward
the health of 500,000 people. Until the
present incumbent was appointed, there
had seldom or never been a physician at
the head of this bureau. For five years
there had not been so much as an annual
report. Two-thirds of the appropriations
to the Pittsburgh Health Bureau
are to-day engrossed in a garbage removal
contract; only one-third is free for
general health purposes. With such an inadequate
barricade, we can imagine that
disease has sacked Pittsburgh throughout
the years; and comparison of death rates
with four cities of corresponding size,&mdash;Boston,
Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis,&mdash;for
five years, shows this to have
been the case. In her average death rate
per 100,000 for typhoid fever, for
diarrhoea and for enteritis, Pittsburgh
was first and highest. Pittsburgh was
only fourth or next to the lowest
in the list in pulmonary tuberculosis;
but in pneumonia, in bronchitis
and in other diseases of the respiratory
system; and in violence other than
suicide, Pittsburgh was highest. To retrieve
the lost ground of years of neglect
of health conditions has been a task upon
which the present superintendent of the
Pittsburgh Bureau of Health has entered,
but it is a task in which the city must invest
increasing resources. For such
work it needs more than a health bureau.
It needs a health department.</p>

<p>My point, then, is that democracy must
overhaul the social machinery through
which it operates if it would bring its
community conditions up to standards
comparable to those maintained by its
banks, its insurance companies and its industrial
corporations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are at least two tests to which
the community can put such social machinery.
The first is that of operating efficiency.
In hospitals, in schools, in municipal
departments, units of work and
output can be worked out as definitely as
are the tons of the steel workers, the voltage
of the electricians, the dollars and
cents of the banks. By vigorous systems
of audit and intelligent systems of budget-making,
understandable to the ordinary
citizen, the community can see to it
that the output of these social institutions
is comparable with the investment
it makes in them; that the taxpayer gets
his money's worth. The Bureau of Municipal
Research in New York embodies
this idea in its program.</p>

<p>There is another, equally intensive test
to which social institutions and sanitary
conditions can be put. It is conceivable
that the tax payer may get his money's
worth from the municipal government,
while the families of the wage earning
population and householders may be suffering
from another and irreparable form
of taxation, which only increased municipal
expenditure along certain lines could
relieve. So it is that while I subscribe
to the movement for stiffer standards of
municipal accounting as a basis for effective
government, for knowing the
waste of a city's money, I subscribe further
to the movement for such methods
of social bookkeeping as will show us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
larger waste of human life and private
means; and will stand out not only for
honesty and efficiency, but for the common
well-being.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate by the case of typhoid
fever which has been epidemic in Pittsburgh
for twenty-five years. To eliminate
typhoid Pittsburgh has erected a
5-1/2 million dollar filtration plant,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for the
years of delay in the erection of which
the city has suffered a terrible toll of
deaths and misery. There were 5,421
cases of typhoid fever in Pittsburgh last
year and 622 deaths. Computing death
rate per 100,000 population for the larger
cities having the highest rates in 1901,
Pittsburgh was first with 124, New
Haven second, Allegheny third; in 1902,
Pittsburgh was first, Allegheny second,
Washington third; in 1903, Pittsburgh
first, Cleveland was second, Allegheny
third; in 1904, Columbus was first, Pittsburgh
second, Allegheny third; in 1905,
Allegheny was first, Pittsburgh second
and Columbus third; in 1906, Pittsburgh
was first, and Allegheny second. But
even these figures, startling as they are,
fail to afford a grasp of the meaning of
this typhoid scourge in the lives of the
wage earners of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh
Survey undertook to gauge this.
In co-operation with Columbian Settlement,
we collected data as to 1,029 cases
in six wards reported in one year; 448
cases were found and studied. Of these
26 died. 187 wage earners lost 1,901
weeks' work. Other wage earners, not
patients, lost 322 weeks,&mdash;a total loss in
wages of $28,899. The cost of 90 patients
treated in hospitals at public or
private expense was $4,165; of 338
patients cared for at home, $21,000 in
doctors' bills, nurses, ice, foods, medicines;
of 26 funerals, $3,186; a total cost
of $57,250 in less than half the cases of
six wards in one year,&mdash;wards in which
both income and sickness expense were
at a minimum. But there were other
even more serious drains which do not
admit of tabulation. A girl of twenty-two,
who worked on stogies, was left in a
very nervous condition, not as strong as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>before, and consequently she could not attain
her former speed. A blacksmith will
probably never work at his trade with his
former strength. A sixteen-year-old
girl who developed tuberculosis was
left in a weakened physical condition. A
tailor who cannot work as long hours as
before, was reduced $1 a week in
wages. A boy of eight was very nervous;
he would not sit still in school and
was rapidly becoming a truant. A mother
developed a case of pneumonia from
over-exposure in caring for children who
had the fever, and she has not been well
since. So the story goes,&mdash;very real
to the lives of the many who are so intimately
concerned. The money losses
can be replaced. My figures include no
estimate of the value of human lives lost.
And it is impossible to compute in terms
of dollars and cents, what it means to a
family to have the father's health so broken
that he cannot work at his old job,
but has to accept easier work at less pay.
It is impossible to put in tabulated form
the total value to a family of a mother's
health, and strike a proper balance when
typhoid has left her a physical or nervous
wreck. It is impossible to estimate
what is the cost to a boy or girl who is
obliged to leave school in order to help
support the family, because typhoid has
incapacitated the natural bread-winners.
Such facts as these show the drain that
typhoid has been on the vital forces of
the community. It is only one of such
drains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> In October there were but ninety-six cases of
typhoid in Greater Pittsburgh, as against 503
for October, 1907.</p></div>

<p>Such facts as these bring home concretely
to the average workingman his
stake in good government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not possible here to enter into a
discussion, even briefly, of the democratic
methods by which a community can
improve the quality and lessen the cost
of its food supplies as an integral part of
the program for building up a vigorous
working population. There is a direct
bearing between these costs of living and
the holding power of the wages paid in
the Pittsburgh District.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But there is one necessity of which
there is a paramount shortage; that is
shelter. I should like you to compare
the efficiency to perform the function for
which it is devised of a modern blast furnace
and the shacks which house some
of the families in the Pittsburgh District.
The output of the one is pig iron; the
output of the other, home life and children.
According to the tenement house
census carried on by the Pittsburgh Bureau
of Health the past summer, there are
3,364 tenement houses in the greater city.
Nearly fifty per cent of these are old
dwellings built and constructed to accommodate
one family and as a rule without
conveniences for the multiple households
now crowded into them. Let me give
you an example,&mdash;a house on Bedford
avenue, with three families in the front
and three in the rear, Negroes and whites.
The owner was notified over a year ago
that the building must be repaired and
certain alterations made, but nothing
has been done, and by the veto of the
governor of Pennsylvania of a bill which
passed the last Legislature, the Bureau of
Health has no power to condemn such unsanitary
dwellings. In this building, two-room
apartments rent for twelve dollars
a month. Water has to be obtained from
a hydrant in the yard, shared by eleven
families; the foul privy vaults are also
shared by neighboring families.</p>

<p>Under Dr. Edwards's administration
5,063 such privy vaults have been filled
and abandoned in Pittsburgh and 8,281
sanitary water closets installed in their
place. The work is less than half done.
The census of only the first twenty wards
of the older city shows a total of nearly
6,000 vaults still existing in these wards
alone. Consider the contrast,&mdash;these old,
ramshackle, unwholesome, disease breeding
appliances of the back country here
in Pittsburgh, the city of the great engineers,
of mechanical invention and of
progress. In a typhoid-ridden neighborhood,
a vault is an open menace to health.
Investigations in army camps and in given
neighborhoods in Chicago have proved
that insects carry disease from such
places to the tables and living rooms of
the people.</p>

<p>There are three points which I should
like you to consider in connection with
this problem of shelter. The first is that
the Bureau of Health, however efficient
in its supervisory work, cannot meet it
single handed. Even if through the activities
of the Health Bureau, Tammany
Hall, Yellow Row and other old shacks
have been torn down, even if the owners
of other old buildings are made to install
sanitary appliances, the situation is still
unmet, unless new houses,&mdash;vast quantities
of new houses,&mdash;are erected to care
for the increased population which has
flooded into Pittsburgh in the last ten
years and which, there is every indication,
will multiply as greatly in the next
ten. Real estate dealers and builders
have not been inactive in Pittsburgh, but
the situation is so serious as to demand
the development of a constructive public
policy that will comprehend such elements
as town planning, tax reform, and
investment at "five per cent and the public
good."</p>

<p>My second point is that this haphazard
method of letting the housing supply
take care of itself is a monetary drawback
to the merchants of the city. In the first
place, it radically reduces the margin
which the workingman's family has to
spend for commodities. Especially is this
true of immigrant tenants, who are obliged
to pay more than English-speaking.
For instance, on Bass street, Allegheny,
we found Slavs paying twenty dollars
a month for four rooms, as against
fifteen dollars paid by Americans. In
the second place, it puts a premium
on the single men, drifters, lodgers,
as against the man with a family. The
immigrant boarders who rent from a
boarding-boss, and sleep eight or ten in
a room or sleep at night in the beds left
vacant by the night workers who have
occupied them throughout the day,&mdash;such
fellows can make money in the Pittsburgh
district. But the immigrant who wants
to make his stake here, bring his family
over, create a household, must pay
ten or fifteen dollars a month for
rooms; and must pay high prices for
all the other necessities of life. If
I were asked by what means the
merchants of Pittsburgh could increase
the volume of purchases of the buying
public, I should say that no one
thing would affect that so impressively
as the multiplication of households,
through the multiplication of low cost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
low rental, sanitary houses to meet the
needs of stable family groups as against
the transient lodger.</p>

<p>My third point is that the housing
problem is not a city problem alone. It
is repeated in each of the mill towns. I
could cite instances in Braddock, Duquesne,
McKeesport, Sharpsburg, where
old buildings are filthy and overcrowded
and where new buildings are put up in
violation of every canon of scientific
housing,&mdash;back-to-back houses such as
were condemned in England seventy-five
years ago as breeding places of disease.
Homestead, for instance, has no ordinance
against overcrowding, no ordinance requiring
adequate water supply, or forbidding
privy vaults in congested neighborhoods.
The foreigners live in the
second ward between the river and the
railroads. In twenty-two courts studied
in this district, only three houses had running
water inside. One hundred and
ten people were found using one yard
pump. Fifty-one out of 239 families
lived in one room each. Twenty-six of
the two-room apartments are used by
eight or more people; one two-room
apartment sheltered thirteen; two,
twelve; two, eleven. A crude reflection
of the effect of these conditions
is indicated by the death rate
in this second ward. Of every three
children born there one dies before it
reaches two years of age, as against one
in every six in the rest of Homestead,
where detached, and livable dwellings
prevail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This comparison of health conditions
in a small town is true in a large, cruel
way of Pittsburgh itself. In co-operation
with the Typhoid Fever Commission
we have analyzed by wards the death certificates
of people dying in Pittsburgh for
the past five years. We have grouped
these wards into districts, the living conditions
of which are more or less of a
kind. Let me compare the mortality figures
of wards nine and ten and twelve,&mdash;a
group of river wards in the old city,
near the mills, peopled for the most part
with a wage-earning population of small
income,&mdash;compare these wards with ward
twenty-two, a new residential district in
the East End. What are the chances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
life of the men, women and children living
in the one and in the other? The
chance of a man's dying of bronchitis in
the river wards is two and a half as
against one in the East End; it is four of
his dying from pneumonia as against one
in the East End, five of his dying of typhoid
as against one in the East End, six
of his dying a violent death as against
one in the East End. These are rough
proportions merely, but they are of terrific
significance. Our American boast
that everybody has an equal chance falls
flat before them. The dice are loaded
in Pittsburgh when it comes to a man's
health; his health is the workingman's
best asset; and the health and vigor of
its working population are in the long
run the vital and irrecoverable resources
of an industrial center.</p>

<p>This brings us to a point where we can
define more concretely the plain civic responsibility
of democracy in an industrial
district. That responsibility is to contrive
and to operate the social machinery
of the community, and to make living
conditions in the district, such as will attract
and hold a strong and vigorous labor
force, for the industries on which the
prosperity of the district must depend.
Here lie the responsibility of the community
to the individual manufacturer,&mdash;and
the responsibility of the community
to its own future:&mdash;that the efficiency of
its workers shall not be mortgaged before
they go to work in the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This carries a counter responsibility.
In the interests of the community as a
whole, in the interests of all the industries
as against the interests of any single
one, the public cannot afford to have such
a working force impaired or wasted by
unsanitary or health-taxing conditions
during the working hours. What I mean
will perhaps be clearest by illustrating in
the case of industrial accidents. Pittsburgh
cannot afford to have over 500
workingmen killed every year in the
course of employment, or the unknown
number of men who are seriously injured.
During the past year, the Pittsburgh
Survey has made an intensive inquiry
into the facts surrounding the
deaths of the entire roster of men killed
in industry during twelve months, and of
the accident cases treated in the hospitals
of the district during three months,&mdash;not
with the idea of raising anew the question
of responsibility for particular accidents,
but to see if there are any indications
as to whether these accidents could
be prevented and whether the burden of
them falls where in justice it should. The
work has been done by a staff of five people,
including a lawyer, an engineer
and interpreters, and we have had the
co-operation of claim agents, superintendents,
foremen, trade union officials
and others. We found that of the 526
men killed in the year studied in Allegheny
county, the accidents fell on
Americans as well as foreigners; 224
were native born. The ranks of steel
workers and train men suffer most,&mdash;the
pick of the workmen in the district.
There were 195 steel workers killed,
125 railroad men, seventy-one mine
workers, and 135 in other occupations.
It was found that it was the young men
of the district who went down in the
course of industry. Eighty-two were
under twenty years of age, 221 between
twenty and thirty. Over half
the men killed were earning less than
fifteen dollars a week, a fact which
raises the question if the law is fair
in assuming, as it does in Pennsylvania,
that wages cover risk. Fifty-one
per cent of the men killed
were married with families to support;
an additional thirty per cent
were single men, partly, or wholly,
supporting a family. It was shown
that the greatest losses were not due
to the spectacular accidents, but to
everyday causes. In the steel industry,
for instance, forty-two deaths were
due to the operation of electric cranes,
thirty-one to the operation of broad
and narrow gauge railroads in the mills
and yards, and twenty-four to falls
from a height or into pits, vats, etc.
Pittsburgh has stamped out smallpox;
its physicians are fighting tuberculosis;
the municipality is checking typhoid.
Cannot engineers, foremen, employers
and workmen come together in a campaign
to reduce accidents? Considerable
has already been done in this direction
by progressive employers. The
problem is that of bringing up the
whole district to progressive standards.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have put these
industrial accident cases to that same
test of human measurement which we
found of such significance in gauging
the losses due to typhoid fever. This
steady march of injury and death
means an enormous economic loss. Is
the burden of this loss justly distributed?
What takes the place of the
wages of these bread-winners? What
resources of their own have these families
to fall back on? What share of
the loss is shouldered by the employer?
What share falls in the long run
upon the community itself, in the care
of the sick and dependent? Is the
Pennsylvania law fair that exempts the
employer from paying anything to the
family of a killed alien if that family
lives in a foreign country? Are the
risks which the law supposes that the
workman assumes when he hires out
for wages, fair risks under modern conditions
of production? Is it in the long
run, to the interest of the employer to
leave to the haphazard, embittered
gamble of damage suits, this question
of meeting in a fair way the human
loss which with even the best processes
and the greatest care, is involved in the
production of utilities? I am not in a
position here to put forward the economic
facts brought out by our inquiries;
but I can say that on every
hand, among employers and claim
agents and workmen, there is profound
dissatisfaction and an increasing open-mindedness
toward some such sane and
equitable system of working-men's
compensation as those in operation in
Germany and in England.</p>

<p>But this question of industrial accidents
is only part of another and larger
question of the relation of industry to
health. The workers of Pittsburgh
are dealing not with simple ploughs
and wash tubs and anvils, but with intricate
machines or in great work
rooms where hundreds work side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
side; dealing with poisons, with voltage,
with heat, with a hundred new and
but half mastered agents of production.
Are the conditions under which some
of this work is carried on directly inimical
to health? Could they be bettered
without serious loss to the trades
and with great gain to the workers?</p>

<p>In the rapid development of factories
in America, we have only begun to devise
our plants with reference to the health
of the worker as well as with reference
to output. Let me illustrate from the
women employing trades. In only two of
the twenty-eight commercial laundries in
Pittsburgh, is the wash room on the upper
floor. In twenty-six, rising steam and
excessive heat not only cause discomfort
in the other departments, but tend
to induce diseases of the respiratory
organs. Tobacco dried in many of the
stogy sweatshops, makes the air heavy
with nicotine, fills the room with fine
dust and increases the danger, always
present in the tobacco trades, from tuberculosis.
In foundries and machine
shops, the custom of placing annealing
ovens in the rooms where the cores are
made, causes excessive heat in the work
room and fill the air with a black dust.
We have the statements of old employes
that not more than twenty-five girls of
the 300 in the coil winding room in one
of the Pittsburgh electrical industries
have been in the plant as long as three
or four years. The speeding-up tends
to make the girls nervous, weak and
easily overcome by illness.</p>

<p>Apart from dangers of accident, of
speeding and of injurious processes,
the health of a working force bears a
direct relation to the length of the
working day. The tendency with respect
to both hours and Sunday work
in the steel industry in Pittsburgh has
been, for fifteen years, towards an increase,
and there is no indication that
the end has yet been reached. There
is not the opportunity here to analyze
the time schedule of the varied departments
of the steel industry, but in a
majority of them the day of twenty-four
hours is split between two shifts
of workers; and the men work not six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
days, but seven a week. And a very
considerable share of them, once a fortnight
in changing shifts, work a long
turn of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Employers may differ as to whether
they can get the most work and the
most effective work out of a man if he
works twelve hours a day, or ten, or
eight. But I hold that the community
has something at stake here. How
much citizenship does Pittsburgh get
out of a man who works twelve hours
a day seven days a week? How much
of a father can a man be who may
never see his babies except when they
are asleep; or who never gets a chance
to go off into the country for a rollick
with his boys? The community has a
claim on the vigor and intelligence of
its people, on their activity in civic
affairs, which I believe it is letting go
by default. It is getting only the tired
out leavings of some of its best men.</p>

<p>My argument, then, is that if the
civic responsibilities of democracy in
an industrial district are to be met, the
community should do what a first-rate
industrial concern would do, figure out
the ground it can cover effectively and
gear its social machinery so to cover
it. By social machinery I mean hospitals,
schools, courts and departments
the city structure, and all that wide range
of activities that have a direct bearing
on the living conditions of a people.
Second, to hold these agencies as closely
accountable as are enterprises in the
business world; and to bring them to
the ultimate touchstone of their effect
on the welfare of the average citizen.
Unless a wage-earning population is so
insured against disease, its vigor and effectiveness
so conserved, the community
is not meeting its responsibilities toward
the industries which must depend upon
these workers for output and profit.
In turn, the public should see to it that
the industries do not cripple nor exploit
the working force which constitutes
the great asset of the community.
And further, if such a program is to be
carried out in an American and democratic
way, the workers themselves
must have greater leeway and leisure
in which to bear their share of the burdens
and responsibilities of American
democracy.</p>

<p>I bear a message to Pittsburgh from
John Burns, president of the Local
Government Board of England, one of
the foremost labor leaders of Great
Britain, who has been hailed this fall
as one of the conserving forces of the
present Liberal ministry in dealing
with the vast economic problems
which are facing the British Empire.
He has visited America and Pittsburgh
as a member of various commissions,
and it was on the basis of
his knowledge of our situation here
that I asked him for suggestions as to
ways of advance, which would lead to
the improvement of civic and labor
conditions in the Pittsburgh steel district.
"Six days work a week instead
of seven," he said. "Three shifts of
eight hours instead of two shifts of
twelve; no twenty-four hour shifts;
better housing; counter-attractions to
the saloon; more parks,&mdash;open spaces;
the improvement of the river front;&mdash;the
humanizing of labor instead of the
brutalization of toil. There you are.
Those are Pittsburgh's marching orders."</p>

<p>Pittsburgh's three rivers and the great
mineral resource's they tap brought the
people here. Environment is inevitable
as a selective agency; but the people once
here, can by their willing, mould and perpetuate
or destroy the holding power of
the district. Other cities have large admixtures
of clerks and trading classes.
I doubt if there is such another working
force in the country as that which
peoples these valleys. Therein lies a
civic resource worth conserving to the
utmost of its potential goods. Will Pittsburgh
as a community, as a democratic
community, meet that responsibility?</p>

<p>Will the industrial communities of
the nation, as democratic communities,
meet their responsibility?</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TREND_OF_THINGS" id="THE_TREND_OF_THINGS">THE TREND OF THINGS</a></h2>


<p>The working woman is coming up as a
result of her invasion of commercial pursuits.
While the department store pays
poorer wages than the factory or domestic
service, it has a standing, its girls a position
due to their dress and their surroundings,
which the others do not give. Grant
it every evil ever charged against it, say Mr.
Hard and Mrs. Dorr in the third article of
their series on The Woman's Invasion, in
the January <i>Everybody's</i>, make the case out
as bad as long hours, poor pay, Christmas
rush time, the need for expensive clothes,
can total. Still it is superior socially; its
hours are shorter; it draws the American
as against the foreign-born girl; it offers
better opportunity for marriage, and all
these things appeal to a girl because she is
not, consciously at least, in industry to stay,
but to pass the time until marriage. That's
why "a store can get for six dollars the kind
of girl that will earn ten dollars in a shoe
factory."</p>

<p>Low as the wages are,&mdash;and they are set
by this social advantage and by the predominant
number of department store clerks
who are not wholly dependent on themselves,&mdash;there
is a chance for real advancement.
Woman has been in factory work
for a century, but she remains an operative
except for occasional forewomen, and as a
result of piece work she quickly reaches her
maximum earning capacity and afterwards
declines. But in the department store,
where she has been only a few years, she
has advanced to positions of real responsibility,
particularly as a buyer, and sometimes
draws a salary of from $1,500 to
$6,000; her wages go steadily up, and the
clerks in some departments draw good, living
wages with the ever-present example of
the buyer and her kind just ahead, elevated
from their own ranks.</p>

<p>The article, in parts, in a stirring description
of the life of the 20,000 department
store clerks on State street, Chicago, and
one of the best parts of it is the contrast of
the girl clerk who sells handkerchiefs, and
the girl machine operative who makes handkerchiefs,
the clerk "getting handkerchiefs
out of boxes for querulous, exacting customers,
putting handkerchiefs back in boxes for
querulous, exacting stock inspectors, taking
parcels to the cage of the wrapper
girl, pacifying purchasers waiting for
their change, attracting new purchasers
coming down the aisle, discriminating between
'buyers' and 'shoppers,' drawing the
'buyers' on, edging the 'shoppers' off, rearranging
the counter,&mdash;from eight or half-past
in the morning to half past five in the
afternoon;" the factory girl sitting before
a counter on which there are a blue cross, a
red cross and a machine with a clutching
hand, who "takes a handkerchief, places it
on the blue cross, pushes it over to the red
cross, and the claw of the machine snatches
it away. She takes a second handkerchief,
places it on the blue cross, pushes it over
to the red cross, and the machine snatches it
away. She takes a third handkerchief, a
fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, an eighth,
two a second, 120 a minute, 7,200 an hour,
all the morning hours, all the afternoon
hours, of every week, all the working weeks
of every year.... The wide prevalence
of this kind of sub-human toil in factories
is one of the two great reasons why
department store managers can often pay
sub-human wages."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Dorr has an article along very similar
lines in the January <i>Hampton's Broadway
Magazine</i>, using with effect little stories
of women workers in many trades. Girls
come out of school at fourteen and go to
work; after a short apprenticeship they are
put at the machines, and quickly earn the
most they ever will earn. Gradually their
nerves, their muscles, their eyes, their efficiency
decline, their wages follow. Later
they stand beside the young apprentices,
earning the minimum wages after a life
spent in a factory.</p>

<p>Women do hard, manual work, too, much
as we have been accustomed to think of
that as peculiar to some European and
Asiatic countries. Indian squaws no longer
till the fields and do the heavy work in
America, but Mrs. Dorr has found a modern
substitute: "Go into the iron and metal
working factories of American cities and see
Polish women working in the heat of horrible
furnaces, handling heavy weights,
doing work fit only for strong men. Go into
the rubber factories of Boston and see Greek
and Armenian women drunk in the fumes
of naphtha. See them in non-union hat factories
with the skin scalded from their
hands as they shrink the felt in streams of
boiling water. We do not want to see American
women doing such things. Yet not a
year ago, in the first months of the panic
of 1907, I received a letter from an American
woman out of employment, asking if it were
not possible for her to obtain work as a
street cleaner. That work, she said, seemed
to her easier than the office scrubbing she
was doing then."</p>

<p>But to return to the factory girl, Mrs. Dorr
declares she is not arraigning those who
own and operate factories, for they are keen
for skilled workers to replace the unskilled
girls who must be driven at a pace set by
the machines; but rather the system under
which our industries are run and by which
we make our workers. The skilled worker
can be made only by training, and in that
she finds the keynote to the whole situation.
Let us establish a great network of industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
training schools, such as the Manhattan
Trade School for Girls and the Hebrew
Technical School for Girls in New York,
and the school maintained by the Woman's
Industrial and Educational Union in Boston.
Then we shall have not only skilled workers,
earning fair wages, but we shall be safeguarding
the mothers of to-morrow and the
Children of the day after.</p>

<p>"The doctor," says Rudyard Kipling in
the January <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, "can
hoist a yellow flag over a center of civilization
and turn it into a desert; he can hoist
a red cross in the desert and turn it into
a center of civilization." He can break the
speed limit, go unmolested through riotous
crowds, forbid any ship to enter any port in
the world and order whole quarters of cities
to be pulled down or burned up.</p>

<p>These are some of his conspicuous privileges.
On the other hand, "in all times
of flood, fire, plague, pestilence, famine, murder
and sudden death it is required of the
doctor that he report himself for duty, and
remain on duty till his strength fails him
or his conscience relieves him,&mdash;whichever
shall be the longer period." There is no
eight-hour law for the physician, no one
cares whether he is "in his bath, or his bed,
or on his holiday, or at a theater."</p>

<p>It is pretty well worth while, though, for
"every sane human being agrees that this
fight for time which we call Life is one of
the most important things in the world, if
not the most important. It follows, then,
that the doctors who plan and conduct and
who re-enforce this fight are among the most
important men in the world."</p>

<p>The Immigration Department of the International
Committee of the Young Men's
Christian Association has issued two attractive
little pamphlets for the newly arrived
immigrant. The policy of the association
is neither to encourage nor to discourage immigration
but to give a helping hand to
those who have fully made up their minds to
immigrate or are already in this country.
The two new books are entitled The Country
to Which You Go, giving an elementary outline
of some of our political and social institutions,
and How to Become a Citizen of
the United States, which gives the immigrant
a clear idea of the process to be undergone
in order to become a voter.</p>

<p>Oscar Straus, secretary of the Department
of Commerce and Labor, says of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
the work of the Immigration Department,
"No nobler, better or more practical work
can be done by the Young Men's Christian
Association than to teach our young men, be
they either native-born or alien, a proper
understanding of the basic principles of our
government."</p>

<p>The last issue of <i>The Outlook for the
Blind</i>, published by the Massachusetts Association
for Promoting the Interests of the
Blind and edited by Charles F. F. Campbell,
contains a chart showing in detail all educational
institutions for the blind in the United
States and Canada, with information of the
training offered, the number of pupils, number
of instructors, and other information.
Presented in this form, the information is
graphic and may readily be compared by
states. The same issue contains articles
on industrial training for the blind, a new
typewriter for the blind, conferences here
and abroad, reports of work in different
states, and some splendidly printed illustrations.
Such an issue seems indispensable to
any one interested in the sightless.</p>

<p>It is to be expected that an anti-suffragist
should take the particular attitude toward
woman clearly manifested by Dr. Lyman
Abbott in The Home Builder.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In speaking
of the wife he says, "Her one dominating
desire is, not to be independent, but to be
dependent on the man she loves." It is
true that Dr. Abbott speaks of the widest
and most perfect unity between man and
wife but it is ever the attitude of the dependent,
the chattel, the possession of man
as the end and aim of the woman's existence.
It is hardly a modern ideal for either
the daughter, the wife, the mother, the
housekeeper or even the philanthropist, as
some of the headings are called. One of the
most valuable points which Dr. Abbott does
bring out, however, is the preservation of
the sense of humor through all of the vicissitudes
of the woman's life. If the book
is intended for a quaint old lady, far away
from the confines of civilization, it might
meet her placid requirements. But it hardly
possesses the philosophy that the modern,
active woman of the larger communities can
find use for.</p>
